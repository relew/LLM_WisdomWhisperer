al-kindi,Who were some philosophers who believed in the past eternity of the world?,"Aristotle, Stoics, and orthodox Neoplatonists were philosophers who believed in the past eternity of the world. They held that the world has always existed and will never cease to exist.",stoicism
alexander-aphrodisias,Why might Alexander's Ethical Problems be particularly significant in the study of ancient ethics?,"Alexander's Ethical Problems are significant in the study of ancient ethics because they provide a link between Aspasius' early commentary on Aristotle's ethics and the later medieval commentaries, filling a gap in the literature during which time ethics may have become a marginal subject in later antiquity. Additionally, these essays address central issues in Aristotle's ethics, such as pleasure as a good and pain as an evil, the relationship between virtues and vices, virtue as a mean, and involuntary actions. Alexander's discussions also reflect the debates of the Peripatetics with the Epicureans and Stoics in Hellenistic times, offering insight into the broader philosophical discussions of the time period. Finally, Alexander's emphasis on logical and physical distinctions in connection with ethical problems provides further depth to the study of ancient ethics.",stoicism
alexander-aphrodisias,"Who establishes a rigorously physicalist system ruled by an all-pervasive divine mind, leading to a sharpened awareness of the determinism problem?","The Stoics established a rigorously physicalist system ruled by an all-pervasive divine mind, leading to a sharpened awareness of the determinism problem.",stoicism
altruism,Which ancient Greek and Roman philosophers are said to have based their moral philosophy on self-interest?,"Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Epicureans are said to have based their moral philosophy on self-interest.",stoicism
altruism,"Why might it be reasonable to consider that being a good person is valuable in and of itself, rather than as a means to an end?","It might be reasonable to consider that being a good person is valuable in and of itself, rather than as a means to an end, because it could be a component of well-being and can lead to the development and exercise of cognitive, emotional, and social skills that we are pleased and proud to have. This perspective is not morally offensive and is supported by arguments from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics who argue that ethical virtue is of great value because it is a component (and for the Stoics the sole component) of one’s well-being.",stoicism
ammonius,What is the 'Reaper' argument in determinism and who is believed to have originally proposed it?,"The 'Reaper' argument in determinism is an argument that suggests that if an event is going to occur, it is necessarily going to occur, and its opposite is necessarily not going to occur. This argument is believed to have originated from Diodorus Cronus and was later discussed by Zeno the Stoic. It is based on the premise that if an event will happen, it cannot be the case that it might or might not happen. Instead, it will definitely happen. Similarly, if an event will not happen, it cannot be the case that it might happen; it will definitely not happen.",stoicism
plotinus,Why does Plotinus criticize Stoic materialism in his anti-Stoic polemics?,"Plotinus criticizes Stoic materialism because he believes it is incapable of articulating an ontology that includes everything in the universe, providing explanatory adequacy in the physical universe, accounting for consciousness or intentionality in materialistic terms, and giving a coherent justification for their ethical position since their exhortations to the rational life cannot explain how one body is supposed to identify with another body.",stoicism
aristotle-commentators,Who was Boethus of Sidon and what was his contribution to the interpretation of Aristotle's Categories?,"Boethus of Sidon was an ancient interpreter of Aristotle's Categories who was active in the second half of the 1st century BCE. He is known for writing a commentary on the Categories in the form of a word-by-word examination of the whole book. Boethus was highly regarded in antiquity for his sharp intellect and his ability to address the difficulties that the Stoics raised against Aristotle's Categories. He resisted the Stoics' reading of the Categories as a treatise on language and about linguistic expressions, and anticipated a line of interpretation that was followed by other ancient commentators such as Porphyry.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What were some of the works written by Antiochus that demonstrated his interests in epistemology and interschool agreements?,"Antiochus wrote an epistemological work called Canonica in at least two books, which discussed the criterion of truth using the term 'kanôn,' meaning a ruler or straightedge. He also wrote a possibly dialogical epistemological work called The Sosus during his controversy with Philo. Furthermore, he sent a book to the Roman Stoic Balbus, arguing that Stoics and Peripatetics shared substantial agreements despite differences in terminology. Unfortunately, the contents of his book about the gods and his works on happiness and virtue relations remain largely unknown to us today.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,"Why was Antiochus of Ascalon, a philosopher who defended Stoic epistemology, able to claim that he was reviving the Old Academy?","Antiochus claimed that the Old Academy, the Peripatos, and the Stoa were in fundamental agreement, and that Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, was mainly responsible for introducing new terminology and making minor corrections to Old Academic doctrine. This allowed Antiochus to defend Stoic epistemology against the arguments made by his Academic predecessors while still claiming to revive the Old Academy. His arguments were embedded in this reinterpretation of Academic history, and were thus part of an argument about who was the legitimate heir of the school’s tradition.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What is one argument regarding Zeno's engagement with Platonism that has been proposed by some scholars?,Some scholars have argued that Zeno's engagement with Platonism was more thoroughgoing than ancient and modern interpreters who have emphasized his debts to Stoicism tend to allow.,stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What was the primary method of argument used by the Academic skeptics in their debates with the Stoics?,"The primary method of argument used by the Academic skeptics in their debates with the Stoics was dialectical, where they would put questions to their interlocutors and deduce conclusions unwelcome to them from their replies. They would take their premises from the doctrines of their Stoic opponents or from assumptions that the Stoics could reject only at a high cost in plausibility.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What is the role of cognitive impressions in Stoic epistemology?,"Cognitive impressions are the criterion of truth in Stoic epistemology. They define it as an impression from what is, stamped and impressed in exact accordance with what is, which allows human beings to discriminate cognitive from non-cognitive impressions. By confining assent to cognitive impressions, it is possible to avoid error entirely.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What was the main target of the Academics' arguments and what consequence did they derive based on this target in the context of Stoic epistemology?,"The main target of the Academics' arguments was the existence of the special character alleged to distinguish cognitive impressions from other impressions. Based on this target, they derived the consequence that nothing can be known in the context of Stoic epistemology. This consequence was derived based on the Stoic doctrine that the wise do not hold (mere) opinions.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What is the self-refuting nature of the Academic skeptical position as argued by the Stoics?,"The Stoics argued that the Academic skeptical position is self-refuting since adopting a position requires assent to its component doctrines, which is impossible without taking oneself to know. Therefore, skepticism as advocated by the Academics undermines its own possibility of being adopted as a position.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What was Philo's response to Antiochus' view of two Academies?,"Philo maintained that there had only ever been one Academy, not two as Antiochus believed. He argued that Academics from Plato to Philo himself were not skeptics challenging the possibility of knowledge, but rather their arguments against cognitive impressions were aimed at showing the impossibility of knowledge on the Stoic conception of apprehension, which he believed was mistaken.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What was Philo's innovation in the Stoic account of knowledge and how did Antiochus respond to it?,"Philo rejected the Stoic account of knowledge which required cognitive impressions to be set apart from other impressions by a special character. Instead, he held that it was enough for there to be impressions which are true and accurately formed. Antiochus was disturbed by this innovation as he believed it brought about the result that knowledge is impossible. Antiochus argued that impressions which fail to satisfy the full Stoic definition of the cognitive impression cannot provide a basis for judgment, let alone judgments that deserve to be called knowledge.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,"Who did Antiochus claim his ethical theory aligned with, and what was the Peripatetic view on goods that Antiochus was defending?","Antiochus claimed that his ethical theory aligned with that of the Peripatetics and Old Academics. The Peripatetic view on goods was that virtue was the sole good, disagreeing with the Stoics who recognized external and bodily items as goods in addition to virtue. Antiochus defended this Peripatetic view about goods based on Stoic considerations and assumptions, rather than Aristotelian frameworks.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What is the Stoic view on what is good and what is indifferent?,"The Stoics hold that only virtue is good, while all other things such as health and strength are indifferent. However, they make a distinction between preferred and dispreferred indifferents, which provide material for rational selection. Virtue consists in fully rational selection among them, with acts of selection being good as expressions of perfected reason.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What was Antiochus' dilemma for the Stoics regarding preferred indifferents?,"Antiochus presented the Stoics with a dilemma that either preferred indifferents were absolutely indifferent, collapsing the Stoic position into that of philosophers who refused to make distinctions among indifferents and rendered virtue incapable of supplying practical guidance. Alternatively, speaking of preferred indifferents was merely verbal innovation, and the Stoics really regarded them as lesser goods, capable of making a life better by their presence and worse by their absence. Antiochus favored the latter diagnosis, holding that virtue is the chief good, but not the sole good.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,"What is the ""cradle argument"" and how is it used in ancient ethics discussions?","The ""cradle argument"" is a method used in ancient ethics discussions to determine the human good by observing the behavior of infants, who have not yet been influenced by society. This approach is based on the principle that the object or objects with which we are naturally concerned or attached by nature provide the basis for determining the human good. The Stoics and Epicureans were known for using this argument, and Antiochus also employed it in his defense of ethics, closely following Stoic theory",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What is Antiochus's view on the relationship between virtue and other goods?,"Antiochus holds that virtue is the highest human good, but he believes that other goods also exist and can be enjoyed in the good life. He distinguishes himself from the Stoics by not making virtue the only good.",stoicism
antiochus-ascalon,What is the key difference between Antiochus' view and that of the Stoics regarding human development and goods?,"Antiochus believes that human development leads to valuing reason above all else because it is the most important part of human nature, while Stoics posit a radical transformation towards virtue. Antiochus also maintains that there is room for other goods in addition to virtue as they align with human nature, whereas Stoics tend to focus solely on reason as the only part of human nature.",stoicism
arabic-islamic-greek,"What two doxographies were translated into Arabic during the early translational period in Baghdad, and what were their sources?","Two doxographies translated into Arabic during the early translational period in Baghdad were the Placita of pseudo-Plutarch, which accounted for Greek cosmologies from the Presocratics to the Stoics, and the Refutation of all the Heresies by Hyppolitus of Rome, which was reworked in light of the theological discussions of 9th century Baghdad and attributed to Ammonius, the Alexandrian commentator of Aristotle.",stoicism
arcesilaus,Who was the leader of Plato’s Academy who started the skeptical phase of the Platonic school and was a critic of Stoic epistemology?,"Arcesilaus was the leader of Plato’s Academy who initiated the skeptical phase of the Platonic school (known as ‘Academic skepticism’) and was an influential critic of the Stoics, particularly their epistemology.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What is the second difficulty faced in reconciling Arcesilaus' dialectical method with certain doctrines?,"The second difficulty is that the conclusions of Arcesilaus' dialectical arguments against Stoic doctrines in epistemology and ethics appear to depend crucially on Stoic premises. However, there is reason to believe that Arcesilaus did not accept anything of Stoic epistemology or ethics, and without independent evidence of his acceptance of their shared premises, there is no consistent picture of which conclusions of his dialectical arguments he may have accepted himself.",stoicism
arcesilaus,Who is the philosopher known for his criticisms of Stoic epistemology?,Arcesilaus is the philosopher known for his criticisms of Stoic epistemology.,stoicism
arcesilaus,What is the Stoic psychological theory of belief formation?,"According to the Stoic psychological theory, to form a belief of any kind is to give one's assent to one's 'impression' (or 'appearance') about the matter.",stoicism
arcesilaus,Why did Arcesilaus argue that there is no cognition on Stoic theory?,"Arcesilaus argued that there is no cognition on Stoic theory because condition [c], which states that an impression is cognitive if its truth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of its causal history such that its propositional content is entailed by its causal history, never obtains. He supported this claim by arguing that it is always possible to have a false impression with exactly the same propositional content and representational character as a true one that meets condition [b], undermining the self-warrant of any impression based on its representational character.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What consequence does Arcesilaus argue that the Stoics must accept if his argument against cognitive impressions is valid?,"If Arcesilaus' argument against cognitive impressions is valid, he contends that the Stoics must accept the conclusion that it is irrational to assent to anything, also known as universal suspension.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What was Arcesilaus' position on the Stoic definition of cognitive impression and how did he argue for it according to Cicero?,"Arcesilaus agreed that the Stoic definition of cognitive impression could never be met, leading to the conclusion that nothing can be known. He maintained premises 5 and 6 of the second argument and concluded that assent to any impression was irrational. This interpretation of Arcesilaus' skepticism is supported in Cicero's dialogues where Arcesilaus is portrayed as following Socrates, Plato, and Presocratic philosophers in concluding that nothing can be known by perception or reason.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What does the text suggest about Arcesilaus' position on Stoic epistemology?,"The text suggests that Arcesilaus argued against many aspects of Stoic epistemology, including the Stoic theory of the soul's interaction with the body, the causal theory of perception, and the conception of belief as assent to an impression. Additionally, there is reason to doubt Cicero's testimony that Arcesilaus subscribed to Stoic views on cognition, as Arcesilaus may not have accepted that there are impressions, that some are true, that there are no other routes to cognition, or that the Stoic definition of cognition gives necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What is the conclusion of Arcesilaus' argument against Stoic thesis regarding some rational assents?,The conclusion of Arcesilaus' argument is that it is rational to 'withhold assent' (‘asugkatathetein’) about everything. This conclusion is used to oppose the Stoic thesis that some assents are rational.,stoicism
arcesilaus,What does Arcesilaus' use of premise [11] suggest about his commitment to epochê?,"Arcesilaus' use of premise [11] suggests that his commitment to epochê is independent of Stoic notions like assent and the irrationality of holding opinions, because it is reached only through the equipollence of arguments.",stoicism
arcesilaus,"What belief about knowledge does the NRNB view attribute to Arcesilaus, based on Cicero's writings?","The NRNB view interprets Cicero as confirming that Arcesilaus was committed to the belief that nothing can be known, as part of his anti-Stoic arguments.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What is one of the problems with the view that radical skeptics have beliefs but do not consider them justified?,"One of the problems is that being a rational agent involves exercising some control over one's beliefs through responsiveness to reasons. According to some philosophers, it is not possible for rational agents to give up practices of justification because having beliefs inherently requires a conscious inference about the proper use of concepts, which is made in virtue of reasons (see Williams 2004). One may argue that the skeptic does not preclude herself from responsiveness to reasons but rather lacks confidence in them, but such rationalist theories of agency and belief might be stricter than even the Stoics' theories, against which Arcesilaus argued (see sect. 5 below).",stoicism
arcesilaus,"How does Arcesilaus argue that action is possible without assent, in response to the first Stoic objection?","Arcesilaus argues that action is possible without assent by suggesting that animal action is triggered directly by their impressions of something oikeion (suitable), and that assent is redundant and liable to be a cause of error. Thus, on his view, one can act on their impressions without necessarily giving assent to them.",stoicism
arcesilaus,"What do Sextus, Cicero, and Numenius suggest about Arcesilaus's commitment to a practical criterion of 'the reasonable'?","Sextus does not provide evidence that Arcesilaus supported 'the reasonable' as a practical criterion, stating that Arcesilaus did not define a criterion and that when he seemed to, it was only as a counterblast to the Stoics. Cicero and Numenius do not mention Arcesilaus's adoption of a practical criterion and suggest that Arcesilaus did not offer a position on how one might live without assent, implying that Carneades significantly revised the Academic position in this respect.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What is one issue with interpreting Arcesilaus' stance solely based on premises 13 through 16?,"One issue is that there is no other evidence suggesting Arcesilaus' commitment to these premises, and they could also be premises that he argued against since reports indicate he opposed not only Stoic theory but all ethical views as well.",stoicism
arcesilaus,What is the connection between Arcesilaus' claim that nothing can be known and the Stoic theory of appropriate actions?,"Arcesilaus suggests that even if nothing can be known, the Stoic theory of appropriate actions can still be followed by performing actions that have reasonable defenses or justifications. This allows the sage to act in accordance with their rationality without having beliefs or opinions. However, Arcesilaus' use of the Stoic definition of appropriate actions implies the possibility of knowledge, which he cannot accept while maintaining his claim that nothing can be known.",stoicism
arcesilaus,Why was it unnecessary for Arcesilaus to be invested in rationalizing the life of the skeptic with a theory of action?,"According to the NRB view, Arcesilaus was not personally committed to defending the life of universal suspension against Stoic counterattack and was instead bound by his method to counter it. Therefore, it was unnecessary for him to be invested in rationalizing the life of the skeptic with a theory of action. Additionally, even if the Stoic objection did not target his own skeptical view, the fact that rational and virtuous action is possible despite his argument for universal suspension of assent would suffice to counter it. This is supported by scholars such as Stopper (1983), although other scholars such as Ioppolo (1986), Maconi (1988), and Thorsrud (2009) have different interpretations of the polemic.",stoicism
arcesilaus,Who was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy?,Zeno of Citium was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy.,stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the Stoic view on the relationship between intellectual and moral virtues?,"The Stoics do not follow the Aristotelian distinction between intellectual and moral virtues. Instead, they hold that all human psychological functions, including the affective and volitional, are rational in a single, unified sense. For them, consequently, all virtues form a unity around the core concept of knowledge.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the Stoic view on the relationship between preferred indifferents and virtue?,"According to Stoicism, preferred indifferents such as health, pleasure, and wealth do not contribute to one's virtue nor detract from it. They do not make one's life better or worse in a moral sense. However, preferred indifferents are still valued since they align with nature's plans for animals and plants, and one should try to preserve and maintain them when possible. Stoics distinguish between preferred indifferents, which are more desirable due to their alignment with nature's plans, and dispreferred indifferents, which hinder the natural order. Nonetheless, they maintain that only virtue and virtuous actions can be considered genuinely good.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the role of reason in human actions according to Stoicism?,"According to Stoicism, reason plays a crucial role in human actions as it is the craftsman of impulse in adult humans. It shapes impulses and guides their expression in action, making it impossible for an adult human, whose nature is to do everything through reason, to merely follow natural impulses without reason's guidance.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What are eupatheiai in Stoicism?,"Eupatheiai are feelings attuned to reason in Stoicism, such as joy over one's virtue. They are distinguished from emotions or passions ( pathê), which are incorrect impulses that treat what is indifferent as good, arising from false judgments about the good.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the Stoic view on the relationship between virtues?,"According to Stoicism, virtues such as courage, justice, and moderation are all unified and derive from a single, comprehensive knowledge of what is good and bad in different kinds of circumstances.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,Why is understanding both one's individual nature as a human being and the way nature arranges the whole universe essential in Stoicism?,"Understanding both one's individual nature as a human being and the way nature arranges the whole universe is essential in Stoicism because this knowledge forms the basis for living in agreement with the government of the universe (nature), allowing one to make decisions and take actions that align with Zeus's or nature's plans, contributing to the overall good.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the Stoic view on how one should respond to the loss of health if happiness is not to be vulnerable?,"According to Stoic philosophy, one should understand that the good of the whole may require the sacrifice of health, recognize that happiness does not depend on having health, and even agree with and desire this outcome as it aligns with the well-governed universe. This response is rooted in the Stoic view that virtue, as living in agreement with nature's government of the universe, is the only good and that one's happiness is entirely determined by his patterns of assent. Renunciation is not involved in this process if Stoic happiness has any relation to the ordinary sense. Instead, it is about acknowledging and adopting the perspective of the universe's well-governed nature.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the role of preferred indifferents in Stoic understanding of living in agreement with nature?,"Preferred indifferents, such as health and wealth, are the raw material of virtue in Stoic philosophy. They cannot be dismissed as they provide opportunities for exercising virtue in their pursuit and use. The goal of the Stoic sage is not merely to attain these preferred indifferents but to strive for them in accordance with right reason, even if it means not attaining them at all. Virtue and happiness are identified with the way one seeks preferred indifferents and the evaluative propositions one assents to, rather than with the attainment of these indifferents themselves.",stoicism
ethics-ancient,What is the dilemma that the Stoics face regarding the role of preferred indifferents in their conception of the end (happiness)?,"The dilemma is that if preferred indifferents such as health are integral to the end (happiness), then they cannot be merely instrumentally valuable; but if they are not integral to the end, then they cannot be the object of choice in all actions.",stoicism
aristotle-ethics,What is the stance of the Stoics regarding common emotions such as anger and fear?,"The Stoics believe that such common emotions as anger and fear are always inappropriate, in contrast to Aristotle's assumption that these emotions are sometimes appropriate and essential for every human being to master and experience in the right way at the right times.",stoicism
aristotle-logic,"Why did Stoic logic, particularly Chrysippus' contributions, lose its prominence in later antiquity compared to Aristotle's logic?","In later antiquity, Aristotle's logic became dominant as it was favored by Aristotelian Commentators. This Aristotelian logic was then transmitted to both the Arabic and Latin medieval traditions, while Chrysippus' works have not survived, leading to their decreased influence in comparison to Aristotle's logic.",stoicism
aristotle-logic,Why is the title Organon significant in understanding Aristotle's views on logic and its role in philosophy?,"The title Organon indicates that Aristotle considered logic as an instrument or tool used by philosophy rather than an inherent part of it. This aligns with the Peripatetic view of logic being a mere tool, distinguishing it from the Stoic stance that views logic as an essential part of philosophy. Organon comprises several treatises, including Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, On Sophistical Refutations, and Topics, along with Rhetoric, which relies on Topics.",stoicism
aristotle-noncontradiction,What is an example given of a philosopher who tried to challenge an argument by turning the tables on their opponent?,"The Stoic philosopher Chrysippus is mentioned as an example of someone who wrote a whole book on table-turning arguments, which suggests that he tried to challenge an argument by turning the tables on his opponent.",stoicism
atomism-ancient,"What was the concern of Epicureans regarding knowledge of imperceptibles, and who did they debate about this issue?","Epicureans believed that all knowledge comes from sense experience and were concerned about the basis for our knowledge of imperceptibles, such as atoms. They engaged in a debate about the grounds for inferences to imperceptible entities with the Stoics, who were another school of thought at that time.",stoicism
augustine,"Who is one of Augustine's main sources for Hellenistic philosophies, specifically Academic skepticism and Stoicism?","Cicero is one of Augustine's main sources for Hellenistic philosophies, specifically Academic skepticism and Stoicism.",stoicism
augustine,"Why did Augustine write his earliest surviving work, Contra Academicos?","Augustine wrote Contra Academicos in order to prove that truth is attainable and knowledge and wisdom are possible, as he wanted to save himself and his readers from the despair that would have resulted if it could not be proven against the skeptic challenge. He was inspired by Cicero's Academica and Hortensius and aimed to present Platonism as a solution to the skeptic problem by limiting the discussion to sense impressions, as original Stoics and Academics did not provide satisfactory answers.",stoicism
augustine,Why did Augustine refrain from officially endorsing traducianism despite its functional value in explaining original sin?,"Augustine refrained from officially endorsing traducianism despite its functional value in explaining original sin because it was a materialist and even biologist theory that ran counter to his Platonism, and it had been brought up by his African predecessor Tertullian, a Stoicizing corporealist who had ended his life as a heretic.",stoicism
augustine,What are two fundamental disagreements between Augustine's theology of grace and ancient Stoic virtue ethics?,"According to Augustine, the most fundamental disagreement between his theology of grace and ancient Stoic virtue ethics is that human beings in their present condition are unable to do or even to will the good by their own efforts. Additionally, Augustine believes that confession of sins and humility are basic Christian virtues, in contrast to the philosophers' confidence in their own virtue that prevents them from accepting the grace of Christ. This confidence is an example of the sinful pride that was at the core of the evil angels' primal sin.",stoicism

carneades,What was the main target of the arguments of the Academic skeptics?,"The main target of the arguments of the Academic skeptics was the epistemology of the Stoics, specifically their belief that it is possible for human beings to achieve a condition of wisdom entirely free of opinion, based on an unshakable grasp of the truth through cognitive impressions.",stoicism
carneades,What is the role of cognitive impressions as the criterion of truth in Stoic epistemology?,"In Stoic epistemology, cognitive impressions serve as the ultimate basis of all knowledge. By restricting assent to these types of impressions, one can allegedly avoid ever assenting to a false perceptual impression, thereby eliminating error and opinion entirely.",stoicism
carneades,What is the first proposition closely associated with ancient skepticism that can be inferred from the absence of cognitive impressions?,"The first proposition closely associated with ancient skepticism is that there are no cognitive impressions, which leads to the conclusion that nothing can be known on Stoic assumptions.",stoicism
carneades,What could have been the goal of Arcesilaus in modeling the skeptic's actions after Stoic doctrines?,"Arcesilaus might have aimed to demonstrate to the Stoics that their system already contained the necessary resources to explain how a skeptic could act, thereby countering the Stoic charge that the Academic arguments for skeptical propositions made rational action impossible.",stoicism
carneades,What is the basis for action or inquiry that Carneades proposed as an alternative to cognitive impressions?,"Carneades proposed that probable impressions could serve as a basis for action or inquiry. These impressions, which invite approval or lend themselves to persuasion, were seen as providing an independent appeal that went beyond anything Arcesilaus had said in response to the same challenge from the Stoics. Carneades' defense of probable impressions was a main reason why he was thought to have departed from the stricter skepticism of Arcesilaus and the Middle Academy.",stoicism
carneades,"What was the aim of the Stoics in their epistemological debate with the Academy, beyond merely establishing the internal consistency of their system?",The Stoics aimed to claim that their views were true and uniquely consistent with common conceptions held by all human beings in their debate with the Academy.,stoicism
carneades,"What was Carneades' strategy in arguing against the Stoics, and why might his theories not reflect his own convictions?","Carneades aimed to show that there were alternatives to Stoicism that could handle agreed-upon considerations as well as or better than Stoicism, while getting rid of its most contentious features. He did this by constructing theories that were not solely based on Stoic doctrines, making them appeal to a wider audience and more easily attributable to him. However, these theories might not reflect Carneades' own convictions, as they were primarily created to challenge Stoicism and meet its self-imposed standards. This approach is dialectical in nature, engaging with the considerations that Stoics recognize as relevant and addressing intelligent, open-minded auditors",stoicism
carneades,What was the purpose of Carneades putting forward the view that the goal is the actual enjoyment of the natural advantages?,"Carneades put forward the view that the goal is the actual enjoyment of the natural advantages in order to suggest that the considerations which support taking the natural advantages as the object of our first natural impulse also count in favor of taking them to be goods and components of the end, challenging the Stoics who took natural advantages as the object of their first natural impulse without considering them as goods and components of the end.",stoicism
carneades,What is an example of something that Carneades criticized in relation to the Stoic definition of the end of life?,"Carneades criticized the Stoic attempts to define the end of life in terms drawn from the arts or technai, which are types of skills or crafts.",stoicism
carneades,"What is the role of Carneades' contributions in the first debate in Cicero's De fato, despite it being incomplete?","Carneades' contributions in the first debate in Cicero's De fato are significant despite its incomplete form as they provide insight into his arguments against both Stoics and Epicureans, possibly defending a consistent position distinct from theirs and offering an alternative way of tackling the issues that avoids implausible choices in their theories.",stoicism
carneades,"What philosophical problem did the Stoics face in maintaining that all things are fated, and how did they resolve it?","The Stoics faced the problem that determinism seems to threaten moral responsibility and undermine the possibility of blame and punishment. They resolved this problem by developing the first compatibilist theory, which holds that voluntary action is compatible with determinism, thereby preserving moral responsibility and the possibility of blame and punishment.",stoicism

moral-character,What do the Stoics conclude about human good according to their philosophical view?,"The Stoics conclude that human good consists in excellent rational activity, as it is under our control, stable, and hard to take away. They believe that a virtuous person, who they call the sage, has and acts on knowledge of the good, which is aligned with the rational order of nature.",stoicism
moral-character,"What is the Stoic view on passions, given that they see them as mistaken judgments?","The Stoics consider passions as mistaken judgments about what is good and evil, and they argue that the sage, being wise, does not have any passions due to having no mistaken judgments about the good. However, natural advantages are still pursued by the sage as ""preferred indifferents,"" serving the purpose of achieving agreement with nature and fully realizing rational powers.",stoicism

childhood,Who are some philosophers that have focused on the issue of moral development?,"Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics are some philosophers who have devoted serious attention to the issue of moral development. Plato offers a model curriculum in his dialogue Republic aimed at developing virtue in rulers, while Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics provides an account of the logical structure of virtues that helps in understanding how moral development takes place. The Stoics also devoted special attention to the dynamics of moral development.",stoicism
daoism,What does Shen Dao advise one to do in order to follow his stoicism?,"Shen Dao advises one to abandon knowledge, which means not to guide one's behavior using prescriptive discourse or learned daoguides, and to discard the self, which means giving up using 'self-other' as a guiding distinction.",stoicism
daoism,What was a result of the introduction of monasticism to China and the development of organized Daoist religions?,"As a result, Daoist religion began to blend with Buddhism in style and content, leading to the emergence of quasi-religious Neo-Daoist stoical quietism influenced by Buddhism in China.",stoicism
emotions-chinese,How have philosophers in the Western tradition historically viewed the relationship between reason and emotions?,"Historically, philosophers in the Western tradition have often viewed reason and emotions as being in conflict with each other. For example, Plato saw the soul as being composed of three parts - reason, spirit, and appetite - and he put reason in opposition to the affective components of the mind. Similarly, Stoic philosophers characterized emotions as inexplicable passions that were disobedient to reason, and Descartes saw passions as internal dispositions moved by external events that could go against rational understanding of the world.",stoicism
zhuangzi,What is the philosophical conclusion that Shen Dao draws based on his version of logical determinism?,"Shen Dao draws an anti-normative, quietist, and stoic conclusion based on his version of logical determinism, which posits that since there is an actual complete history of space-time, our behavior tomorrow is already included in it, and therefore we should abandon knowledge of how to make linguistic distinctions and simply follow the Great Dào (the actual course of cosmic history from past to future).",stoicism
christiantheology-philosophy,Why might early Christian thinkers not have endorsed a sharp distinction between philosophy and theology?,"Early Christian thinkers may not have endorsed a sharp distinction between philosophy and theology because they typically did not understand themselves as ""theologians"" in contrast to ""philosophers"". Instead, they reasoned about their Christian commitments in the intellectual idiom of the ancient Mediterranean world, which was shaped by Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic philosophy.",stoicism

cicero,How does Cicero's use of dramatic dialogue in his work challenge readers in their engagement with political philosophy?,"Cicero uses dramatic dialogue in his work to encourage readers to critically examine topics related to political theory, while also challenging them to consider the limited scope of human (and Roman) domains in comparison to Stoic universalism and cosmology. The work's structure invites readers to maintain a critical perspective on political philosophy as a whole, even as they delve into specific discussions on various forms of government.",stoicism

cicero,What does Cicero's dismissal of Epicurean and sceptical viewpoints suggest about the real world and the ideal one of perfected reason?,"Cicero's dismissal of Epicurean and sceptical viewpoints suggests that in the real world, where there are competing and critical opinions, it is important to recognize that the universalist theory of natural law is itself a product of a particular philosophical school (Stoicism). This contrasts with the ideal world of perfected reason, where there may be no room for divergence of opinion about what justice is if the idea of natural law is correct.",stoicism
cicero,What is the main topic of Cicero's work On Ends or On Moral Ends?,"The main topic of Cicero's work On Ends or On Moral Ends is the question of what are the highest goods that bring about a happy human life. The work compares and evaluates three leading ethical theories of Cicero's time: Epicureanism, Stoicism, and the Old Academy theory.",stoicism
cicero,Why couldn't Stoic doctrines be directly applied in certain public contexts during Roman times?,"Stoic doctrines couldn't be directly applied in certain public contexts during Roman times because they would not be well-received or understood by Romans in legal proceedings, political assemblies, senate meetings, or military situations. For example, Stoics considered exile, confiscation, captivity, enslavement, and death as mere indifferent things, not as evils, which was in stark contrast to common Roman beliefs. Additionally, Stoics held that true virtue was rare and difficult to achieve, so it would be challenging for them to attribute victories and triumphs to virtue in public contexts where such accomplishments were expected of leaders.",stoicism
cicero,What is Cicero's criticism of the Stoics regarding their inability to express their doctrines about virtue in public contexts without incurring ridicule or incomprehension?,"Cicero argues that the Stoics are left with hypocrisy, using ordinary language in public and their own language in their writings, due to their emphasis on agency and public participation, and their unconventional views on virtue that differ from popular understanding.",stoicism
cicero,What is the aim of Cicero in his dialogical structure in discussing Stoic and Epicurean ethics?,Cicero aims to provoke debate and encourage his readers to consider to what extent ethical theory must be answerable to social reality. He invites readers to consider whether an ethical theory that cannot be lived consistently is flawed as a theory.,stoicism
cicero,"What is Cicero's goal in his work On the Nature of the Gods, and what approach does he take to achieve this goal?","Cicero's goal in On the Nature of the Gods is to examine critically all the available views about the gods, creating a philosophical encyclopedia that goes beyond simply presenting different philosophical views. He is inspired by the approach of the Academic sceptic and aims to challenge existing theories in order to stimulate the pursuit of truth, as demonstrated by Carneades' impact on Stoic theology.",stoicism
cicero,"What are the focus of Books 2 and 3 in Cicero's ""On the Nature of the Gods""?","The focus of Book 2 is an exposition of Stoic theology by Balbus, while Book 3 consists of a critique of Stoic theology by Cotta. In contrast to Book 1's Epicurean theology, Stoic theology emphasizes that god manages the workings of the universe down to the smallest detail.",stoicism
cicero,"How does Stoic theology, as presented by Balbus, attempt to appeal to a Roman audience?","Stoic theology, as presented by Balbus, attempts to appeal to a Roman audience in two ways: by offering a less technical presentation that encourages engagement from readers who may be unwilling or unable to engage with more complex philosophical theories, and by portraying the gods as taking an interest in the wellbeing of Rome, thereby certifying a sense of specialness and pride in the Roman nation.",stoicism
cicero,"What is the main point of difference between the Stoic and Epicurean views of theology, and how does Balbus adapt this point in his speech to appeal to a Roman audience?","The main point of difference between the Stoic and Epicurean views of theology is that the Stoics believe that the gods are concerned with human wellbeing and actively promote it, while the Epicureans do not. Balbus, in his speech, adapts this point to appeal to a Roman audience by emphasizing that this providential outlook has Rome as its primary focus, suggesting that the gods favor Rome over other nations.",stoicism

These can be found in Cicero, some Latin Stoics, and in the Protestant tradition started by Luther.",stoicism
consequence-medieval,Why is medieval logic significant in the history of logic?,Medieval logic is significant in the history of logic because it represents the first sustained attempt at adopting a sentential/propositional perspective since the Stoics in Greek antiquity and provides the historical background for subsequent developments leading to the birth of modern logic in the 19th century. The medieval concept of consequentia is also considered the main precursor of the modern concept of logical consequence.,stoicism

cosmopolitanism,What is the practical implication of Stoic's belief in living in agreement with the cosmos?,"The Stoics believe that living in agreement with the cosmos requires serving other human beings as best one can, and serving all human beings equally well is impossible. Therefore, they insist that political engagement is necessary to help human beings as such, and sometimes the best way to do that is to serve as a teacher or as a political advisor in some foreign place. Thus, a cosmopolitan considers moving away in order to serve, whereas a non-cosmopolitan does not.",stoicism
cosmopolitanism,What is the implication of Stoic cosmopolitanism for the obligations of an individual according to the Roman Stoics?,"According to Roman Stoics, Stoic cosmopolitanism implies that individuals have obligations to all human beings by virtue of their rationality, and they should determine whom they can best help and how, with the aim of helping human beings as such in the best way they can.",stoicism
cosmopolitanism,Why is it incorrect to claim that Stoic cosmopolitanism became popular solely as a response to political changes in the Greco-Roman world?,"It is incorrect to claim that Stoic cosmopolitanism became popular solely as a response to political changes in the Greco-Roman world because the cosmopolitan ideal was already rooted in intellectual developments that predate Alexander’s conquests. Moreover, local political engagement remained significant after the fall of the polis and even under the Roman Empire, indicating that political factors alone do not fully explain the emergence and success of Stoic cosmopolitanism. Instead, the cosmopolitan ideal resonated with people due to various reasons, including the influence of empires that made many individuals more receptive to this concept.",stoicism
cosmopolitanism,How did early Christians view the relationship between traditional politics and human goodness in light of Stoic cosmopolitanism?,"Early Christians believed that traditional politics played a secondary role in promoting human goodness.

deleuze,"What is the unique status of sense in Deleuze's philosophy, according to which it cannot be reduced to either propositions or states of affairs?","Sense is both the expressed of the proposition and the attribute of the state of affairs, but it is not reducible to either. It exists as a boundary between propositions and things, subsisting or insisting rather than existing in its own right. Sense is not physical or mental but rather incorporeal, and is discovered by the Stoics through their distinction between corporeal mixtures and incorporeal events. The Battle of Waterloo is an example of an incorporeal event or sense, which cannot be identified with any particular state of affairs, quality, or relation of states",stoicism
descartes,What was the philosophical background that Descartes was exposed to during his school years?,"Descartes was exposed to scholastic Aristotelian philosophy in his school years, but he also learned about the doctrines of ancient atomists, Plato, Stoics, and skeptics through textbook presentations and commentaries on Aristotle's works. Furthermore, important intellectual events such as the discovery of the moons of Jupiter by Galileo in 1610 were known at his school, La Flèche.",stoicism

emotions-17th18th,Who were some of the important early influences on early modern discussions of the emotions?,"Aristotle and Stoicism were particularly important early influences on early modern discussions of the emotions. Aristotle's ideas on the classification of the faculties of the soul and the location of the emotions among the appetites of the sensitive part were widely accepted, as were Aquinas's further distinction between the irascible and concupiscible passions. Stoicism was also influential, but its doctrines were met with a mixed reception. Some early modern philosophers rejected certain Stoic views, such as the idea that the passions are erroneous judgments. Other philosophers, such as Pascal and Malebranche, borrowed from Augustine a sense of human insufficiency that put them at odds with Stoic, Skeptical, and Epicurean ideals of the autonomous life of the sage.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,Why does the Stoic Chrysippus argue that the past is necessary?,The Stoic Chrysippus argues that the past is necessary because it is immutable and we cannot now do anything to change it. This is in contrast to Cleanthes' view who preceded him as head of the Stoa.,stoicism
freedom-ancient,Which philosophers did Cicero include in his discussion of the relationship between causal determinism and the principle of bivalence in On Fate?,"In On Fate, Cicero included Epicurus, the Academic skeptic Carneades, and the Stoic Chrysippus in his discussion of the relationship between causal determinism and the principle of bivalence.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,"What is the relationship between the principle of bivalence for statements about the future and causal determinism, according to Epicurus and the Stoics?","According to Epicurus and the Stoics, the principle of bivalence with regard to statements about the future is interentailing with causal determinism. This means that a statement about the future is true if and only if there exists at that time sufficient causal conditions to bring about the state of affairs described in the statement. Conversely, a statement will be false if and only if there exist sufficient conditions to preclude the state of affairs described in the statement, and neither true nor false if current conditions are sufficient neither to bring about nor to preclude the state of affairs described in the statement. The Stoics express this idea by saying that if conditions are sufficient to bring about a certain state of affairs, then it is necessary that it will happen, and if conditions are sufficient to preclude a certain state of affairs, then it is necessary that it will not happen.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,What is the view of both Epicurus and the Stoics regarding the truth value of statements about events that are not causally determined?,"Both Epicurus and the Stoics agree that if there is motion without a cause, then not every statement is either true or false. This is because the future has not occurred yet, so nothing exists at present to make a statement about the future true unless there presently exist sufficient conditions to bring about the state of affairs predicted by the statement.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,How do the Stoics conceive of fate in relation to God's providential will?,"According to the Stoics, fate is an everlasting ordering and sequence of causes that brings about every single thing that has happened, is happening, and is going to happen, including the realization of God's providential will in making the world the best he can through setting up the causal order of the world to bring it about.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,How does a Stoic philosopher like Chrysippus understand the relationship between an action and its outcome in cases where the outcome is fated?,"According to Stoic philosopher Chrysippus, in cases where an outcome is fated, an action is both causally determined and causally efficacious in bringing about its purpose. For instance, if it is fated that a person will recover from cancer, then it is also fated that they will seek treatment, and their action of seeking treatment is what brings about their recovery. In this way, deliberation and action are not pointless even if the outcome is fated, because they are causally necessary for the outcome to occur.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,What is the Stoics' stance on the necessity of events that have been causally determined?,"The Stoics reject the idea that events that have been causally determined are necessary in the sense of being inevitable or beyond our power to effect. They believe that even if an action is causally determined and one does not have the ability to choose between opposite actions, seeking treatment can still lead to a cure that would not have happened if one had not sought treatment.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,"Why does the vicious person fail in their attempt to defy the will of god, according to Stoicism?","In Stoicism, even the attempted defiance of the vicious person has been fated by god, so their attempt is doomed to fail from the start. This is because god's providential plan encompasses everything that occurs in the cosmos, including attempts to defy god's will.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,How do Stoics understand animal motion and its relation to an internal source?,"Stoics understand animal motion as being caused by an internal source, which is the animal's own mind. They believe that this is different from inanimate objects that are moved around from the outside. The Stoics also think that animal motion being causally determined is compatible with animals moving themselves around when an impression occurs that arouses an impulse, as seen in the example of a hungry dog running towards a hunk of meat after seeing it.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,How does Chrysippus use the analogy of a rolling stone cylinder in illustrating the Stoic doctrine of the internal source of animal motion?,"Chrysippus uses the analogy of a stone cylinder rolling down a slope to illustrate the Stoic doctrine of the internal source of animal motion by explaining that just as the cylinder's own shape and ""rollability"" are the primary cause of its motion after an initial shove, similarly, in human action, an initial impression may serve as a trigger, but how a person acts depends on their own character and response to their impressions.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,What is the stance of Stoics on the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)?,The Stoics reject the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP).,stoicism
freedom-ancient,How do Stoics view virtue in relation to doing what one should?,"For Stoics, virtue is a reliable disposition that enables a person to live well and consistently do what they should. They view the ability to act against virtue as a defect, a form of folly, and a disability, as it goes against living well.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,What is the Stoic's view on how their belief in causal determinism by God is compatible with moral practices?,"The Stoics believe that their doctrine of causal determinism is compatible with moral practices because they think that right reason still commands right actions and prohibits wrong ones. Even if an action is causally determined by God, they argue that we can still give reasons why an action is irrational and wrong, and why an alternative course of action would be rational and right. In this way, they argue that it is possible to judge an action as virtuous or vicious, and that commendable actions deserve honor while reprehensible actions deserve censure and punishment.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,What is the Stoic view on retributive punishment and what is their model for punishment?,"The Stoics reject retributive punishment, which seeks to set back a person's interests as fitting payback for the wrong they have done. Instead, they advocate for rehabilitative punishment that aims to correct the person being punished. Their model for punishment is akin to parental discipline, where punishment is inflicted not because they want the person to suffer but because they think it will be good for them and help them realize their mistakes.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,Why do Stoics believe that only the wise person is truly free?,"Stoics believe that the wise person is truly free because they have mastered themselves and are in harmony with themselves, unlike the fool who is dominated by alienating and disturbing desires and beliefs that are not in line with their nature as rational beings. The fool is often compared to a slave or a puppet, jerked here and there by irrational impulses, while the wise person's actions are in line with right reason which commands all virtuous actions and forbids all vicious actions.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,"What does Alexander argue is necessary for effective deliberation, and how does he think this is incompatible with causal determinism?","Alexander argues that effective deliberation requires that a person have the ability to do otherwise than they do, meaning they must have the ability to choose between alternative actions. He thinks this ability is incompatible with causal determinism, which is the Stoic position that every event has a cause which is sufficient to produce exactly that outcome, and that given the totality of circumstances, it is causally impossible for things not to turn out the particular way that they do. In this view, if something is causally determined to happen, it is impossible for it not to happen, which leaves no room for alternative possibilities that deliberation seems to require.",stoicism

freedom-ancient,What is the ethical ideal that both Plotinus and the Stoics subscribe to regarding freedom?,"According to Plotinus and the Stoics, freedom is the ideal of being in control of one's actions through reason and not being controlled by external factors such as appetites or passions. They believe that only the wise person is truly free in this sense.",stoicism
freedom-ancient,How do Stoics and Plotinus differ in their views on the relationship between mind and matter in explaining the operations of the cosmos?,"The Stoics hold that god's mind is a material substance that pervades the cosmos and causally determines every event through its organization of matter, which includes our minds. In contrast, Plotinus maintains that there is a clear distinction between the causal influences of matter and mind in the operations of the cosmos. He considers matter as the lowest form of beings, while the One, the divine intellect, soul, and our intellects are all immaterial entities that stand above matter.",stoicism

dialectical-school,"Who were the first to write about predicates and propositions in logic, and what kind of logic did they develop?","The first to write about predicates and propositions in logic were Clinomachus of Thurii and the Dialectical school, and they developed a precursor of Stoic logic that was a logic of propositions, as opposed to Aristotle's logic of terms which had subject and predicate terms as interchangeable entities.",stoicism
dialectical-school,"What issue does Diodorus' criterion share with the modern concept of strict implication, and how does Stoic Chrysippus address these issues in his system of relevance logic?","Diodorus' criterion shares with the modern concept of strict implication the issue of not requiring a connection of content between antecedent and consequent. In Diodorus' system, conditionals are true if the antecedent is impossible or the consequent is necessary, regardless of their relevance. This is similar to the 'paradoxes of strict implication'. Stoic Chrysippus developed a system of relevance logic that avoids both 'the paradoxes of material implication' and 'the paradoxes of strict implication' by ensuring a relevant connection between antecedent and consequent in conditionals.",stoicism
dialectical-school,"What aspect of modality were Diodorus, Philo, and the Stoics mainly interested in, as opposed to considering modal propositions or iterated modalities?","Diodorus, Philo, and the Stoics primarily considered modality as properties of propositions or states of affairs, rather than discussing modal propositions that contain modal operators or iterated modalities.",stoicism
dialectical-school,What were the conditions that a viable reconstruction of the Master argument in ancient Stoicism must satisfy?,"A viable reconstruction of the Master argument in ancient Stoicism must satisfy several conditions. It must make use of the principles (I) and (II) handed down in Epictetus; it must make use solely of premises that were plausible to the Stoics; it must appear valid; it must employ only the logical means and concepts available in antiquity, with notions of proposition, consequence, and modalities that fit in with the logic of the time; and it must be possible to formulate the argument in ordinary language. Additionally, the restored argument should not have a complexity which precludes its presentation at a social gathering, since it appears that people enjoyed discussing the Master argument over dinner in ancient times.",stoicism
dialectical-school,What is the meaning of the Stoic term 'parelêluthos' in relation to time?,"The Stoic term 'parelêluthos' refers to propositions about the past, but it does not mean that the proposition itself existed in the past.

diodorus-cronus,What happened to Diodorus's school and where did some of his key ideas end up?,"Diodorus's school did not last far into the third century BCE and some of his key ideas were appropriated by the dominant schools of the age, namely the Stoics, the Epicureans and the sceptically inclined dialecticians of the New Academy. Diodorus's propositional logic became the basis of the Stoic logical system, his Master Argument stood at the center of Hellenistic debates about determinism, his theory of minima was endorsed by Epicurus as a key part of his own physical atomism, and some of Diodorus’s dialectical paradoxes, most notably the Sorites, became integral to the methodology of the New Academy.",stoicism
economics-early-modern,"What is the attitude of Adam Smith, who is often associated with the voice of capitalism, towards wealth and its impact on human nature?","Adam Smith, who is often associated with the voice of capitalism, had a disparaging attitude towards wealth and its impact on human nature. He believed that wealth and greatness were mere trinkets, and that the pursuit of wealth could reinforce the baser features of human nature, such as vanity and greed. Smith endorsed rising standards of living for the lower orders, but his stoicism was the more dominant sentiment. He held that life was a lottery and one had best prepare for adversity.

medieval-emotions,How did Augustine adapt the Stoic doctrine of first movements to fit with the Christian conception of sin?,"Augustine taught that sinful thoughts which easily and frequently came to mind because of original sin became sins through a subsequent assent, which is similar to the Stoic doctrine of first movements where even apathetic people might react quasi-emotionally on exceptional occasions, but this was not really an emotion because it did not involve judgmental assent.",stoicism
medieval-emotions,What is an example of a classification of emotions in a medieval philosophical context?,"In the medieval philosophical tradition, Isaac of Stella classified emotions into two categories: concupiscible and irascible. Concupiscible emotions are directed towards good objects, while irascible emotions are directed towards harmful ones. An example of an irascible emotion in this classification is distress.

He mentions reading their treatises in his teachings, and there are many similarities between their thoughts and those of Epictetus, particularly in the foundational period of Stoicism.",stoicism
epictetus,"What is the Stoic view on the origin of emotions such as grief, fear, envy, and desire?","According to Stoicism, emotions such as grief, fear, envy, and desire result from the incorrect supposition that happiness is to be found outside oneself. These emotions are not imposed on us by circumstances or internal forces beyond our control, but rather, they are an expression of our judgments of value.",stoicism
epictetus,"How does Epictetus conceptualize the mind, according to Stoicism?","According to Stoicism, Epictetus conceives of the mind as consisting of pneuma (""breath"" or ""spirit""), a material substance with certain remarkable powers. He explains the faculty of vision by the activity of pneuma infused by god into the eyes, as well as by the energy and tensility of the air through which things are seen.",stoicism
epictetus,What is the intention of Epictetus's schema of three disciplines and how does he view the study of logic?,"Epictetus's schema of three disciplines (desire, action, and assent) is intended primarily to deemphasize the role of logic, but he is not averse to the study of logic if it is given its proper supporting role. He believes that learning of this kind may be instrumental in developing one's intellectual acumen, just as weights used by athletes in their training serve to develop their muscles. The schema should not be identified with the three divisions of philosophical discourse discussed by the early Stoics (viz. physics, ethics, and logic).",stoicism
epictetus,What are the three modes or characters of philosophical discourse distinguished by Epictetus in Discourses 3.23.33?,"The three modes of philosophical discourse distinguished by Epictetus in Discourses 3.23.33 are the protreptic mode, which convinces hearers to care about philosophical study as a means toward personal ethical development; the elenctic mode, which is more confrontational and aimed at removing false convictions; and the instructional mode, which imparts sound doctrines. These modes are associated respectively with Diogenes the Cynic, Socrates, and Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic school.",stoicism

episteme-techne,What is the role of reason in the Stoic's account of impulse and action?,"In the Stoic's account of impulse and action, reason is said to be the craftsman (technitês) of an adult human's impulses. This means that reason supervenes on what would be purely automatic impulses in other animals and guides adult humans in seeking what is appropriate (oikeios) to them and rejecting what is not appropriate.",stoicism
episteme-techne,How do Stoics understand the relationship between reason and impulses in human beings?,"According to Stoics, reason is the craftsman of all adult human impulses, with no division between rational and non-rational parts of the soul. Reason controls impulse solely by its judgments, and emotions cannot pursue as good something different from what reason takes to be good. In those who know what the good is, reason gives rise to impulses that aim only at virtue, while in those who don't know what the good is, reason can give rise to mistaken impulses based on false beliefs about what is good.",stoicism
episteme-techne,"What kind of knowledge does the Stoic concept of phronêsis correspond to, according to Sextus?","According to Sextus, the Stoic concept of phronêsis corresponds to knowledge (epistêmê) of the good and the evil. This knowledge provides a technê concerning life, enabling the sage to have insight into what is good and bad in each situation of life, and to react appropriately both in the way he feels and in the way he acts.",stoicism
episteme-techne,What is the Stoic view of the highest good according to Cicero's On Ends?,"According to Stoics, making every effort to obtain primary objects of nature, even if unsuccessful, is morality and is the only thing desirable for itself and the highest good.",stoicism
episteme-techne,What activity does the Stoic Cato use as an analogy to explain the relationship between natural objects of desire and moral action?,"The Stoic Cato uses marksmanship as an analogy to explain that moral action is really the end of life, while natural objects of desire such as health are pursued in a moral way as a means to that end.",stoicism

equality,What moral principle developed among the Stoics and in early New Testament Christianity that emphasizes the natural equality of all rational beings?,"The moral principle of substantive, universal, moral equality developed among the Stoics and in early New Testament Christianity.

evolution-before-darwin,"What is one of the main points of disagreement between the early atomists and later philosophical traditions such as Platonism, Neo-Platonism, Aristotelianism, and Stoicism regarding the origin of living beings?","The main point of disagreement is that the early atomists proposed that living beings were formed by chance-like processes, while later philosophical traditions argued that living beings were the result of an externally imposed origin through the action of an intelligent agency who orders matter into a rational cosmos that includes living beings in accord with eternal archetypes or forms. This notion of teleological design was further developed in ancient discussions of creation and interacted with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Biblical concepts of creation, but is not accurately identified with the Biblical concept of creatio ex nihilo.",stoicism

feminist-religion,What philosophical concept does Daly's work draw from and relate it to a Marxist's idea?,"Daly's work is deeply influenced by a philosophical concept that goes back to the Stoic logos spermatikos, the ""seed"" that links every person with the divine reason. This idea is similar to the Marxist Ernst Bloch's concept of ""revolutionary Prometheanism."" It is also connected to the medieval mystic's talk of a ""scintilla animae,"" the ""spark of the soul,"" which Daly frequently echoes in her books.",stoicism

forgiveness,What does Stoic Seneca claim about anger in relation to the moral life?,"According to Stoic Seneca, all forms of anger are inconsistent with the moral life because they dispose us to cruelty and vengeance, which passions encourage us to see other people as less than fully human.

foucault,"What important philosophical concept did Foucault focus on in his later lectures, and what ancient philosophers did he discuss in relation to this concept?","Foucault focused on the concept of ""philosophy as a way of life"" in his later lectures, discussing ancient philosophers such as Socrates, Epictetus, Seneca, Plutarch, Euripides, and the Epicureans, Stoics, and Cynics in relation to this concept. He was particularly interested in the idea of ""care of the self"" and the virtue of ""truthful speaking"" (parrhesia).

frege,In what areas does Bobzien compare the semantic theories of the Stoics and Frege?,"Bobzien compares the semantic theories of the Stoics and Frege in several areas including the relationship between semantic 'content' (Greek lekta v. Fregean Sinn) and linguistic expression, the distinction between complete and incomplete content, the relationship between truth and falsity, and the content expressed by commands, sentence questions, expressions of emotion, word questions, and indexicals. She also compares their doctrines regarding complex contents produced with propositional connectives such as negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, conditionals, and sentences with 'because', as well as their approaches to quantification and universality.",stoicism

medieval-futcont,How did some Stoics interpret Aristotle's claim about future contingents in Perihermeneias II?,"Some Stoics interpreted Aristotle's claim that future contingents are not disposed more to being than not being as meaning that they are neither true nor false, and that they are falsely thought of as one or the other.",stoicism
medieval-futcont,Why did some Stoics believe in the predetermination of all future events?,"The Stoics believed in the predetermination of all future events because they took the universally valid principle of bivalence, which states that every proposition is either true or false, to imply this predetermination.",stoicism
galen,What indicates that ancient philosophers were highly interested in logical and methodological questions?,"The existence of numerous works on logic and linguistic matters, as well as specific texts dedicated to analyzing the arguments of ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, his school, the Stoics, and Plato, suggests that ancient philosophers had a strong engagement with logical and methodological questions.",stoicism
galen,"How does Galen view the Stoic concept of a ""kataleptic"" impression in relation to secure knowledge?","Galen regards the distinction between ""kataleptic"" and his preferred term, ""securely knowable,"" as purely verbal and does not find it to be of philosophical interest. He does not seem to feel a serious philosophical challenge from the Skeptical objection that one may believe one has a reliable perception also in dreams or in mentally deranged states.",stoicism
galen,Why is it challenging to accurately summarize Galen's contributions and final views on logic and argumentation?,"It is challenging to accurately summarize Galen's contributions and final views on logic and argumentation due to the loss of his most important work, Demonstration, except for fragments, and the ongoing debate among experts regarding the precise nature of his innovations and originality in this area. The complexity of the subject matter and interpretive difficulties further complicate providing a clear overview of Galen's ideas and their relationship to those of Aristotle and the Stoics.",stoicism
galen,What is the significance of Galen's innovation of the relational syllogism?,Galen introduced the relational syllogism in response to what he perceived as inadequacies in both Aristotelian and Stoic logic. He believed this new type of syllogism to be of particular relevance for proofs in geometry and mathematics. This innovation highlights Galen's critical analysis of existing logical theories and his contribution to their development.,stoicism
galen,"How has the assessment been of Galen's contribution to logic, as far as clarity, consistency, and fulfillment of ambition is concerned?","The assessment of Galen's contribution to logic has been found problematic in terms of clarity and consistency, and it has ultimately been disappointing in its inability to fulfill its stated ambition. However, it is recognized that Galen made a unique and influential contribution in this field, synthesizing Aristotelian and Stoic logical traditions while maintaining a practical focus on the value of logic.",stoicism
galen,What is the relationship between element-bodies and element-qualities in Galen's element theory?,"In Galen's element theory, element-bodies (fire, air, earth, water) are the outcome of the reception of element-qualities (hot, cold, wet, dry) into quality-less matter. Galen's model is influenced by both Aristotle's and Plato's element theories, but his use of the term ""quality-less"" matter has Stoic origins.",stoicism
galen,What is the difference between the Stoic theory and Galen's view regarding the element-quality correspondences in the human body?,"According to the Stoic theory, each element-body corresponds to the extreme of one element-quality, while Galen seems to highlight one-to-one correspondences between element-bodies and element-qualities, focusing on the element-bodies as instantiating the element-qualities in their ""uncombined and unmixed"" states. However, Galen remains committed to the Aristotelian view where each element-body arises from a pairing of element-qualities. There also seems to be some vacillation in Galen's work regarding which quality is present in its extreme form.",stoicism
galen,What is the role of pneuma in Galen's physiology and how is it connected to the soul?,"In Galen's physiology, pneuma plays an important role in communicating vital (involuntary) function and tension through the arteries and in communicating perception and voluntary motion from and to the brain through the nerves. Galen even considers the possibility of the identity of soul and pneuma, but his considered view is that pneuma functions as the soul's ""first instrument."" However, Galen's theory in this area is fundamentally anatomical in nature and does not adopt Stoic metaphysical views in this area. Its connections with anatomically based medical theories of Herophilus and Erasistratus seem more relevant than Stoic metaphysical understanding of pneuma and its function.",stoicism
galen,How does Galen describe the relationship between the bodies of the substances that undergo total mixture in Stoic theory?,"Galen seems to prefer the formulation that the bodies do not co-inhabit one space, but rather the qualities of the substances undergo total mixture in Stoic theory.",stoicism
galen,"What is Galen's position in the debate over the location of the hēgemonikon, as compared to the Stoics?","Galen refutes the Stoic view of the hēgemonikon being in the heart and asserts his allegiance to the Platonic view of its location in the brain. However, it can be argued that his view of the soul's ""command center"" is conceptually closer to the Stoic one.",stoicism
galen,What was the disagreement between Stoics and Platonic-Aristotelians regarding affections?,"The Stoics believed in the total eradication of affections, considering any submission to pathos as a form of madness. On the other hand, the Platonic-Aristotelian view advocated for a moderate level of affectedness (metriopatheia). Galen's ethics do not explicitly use the term metriopatheia, but his work seems consistent with the aim of eradicating the pathē. However, Galen argues against the necessity of total eradication in his work Ind., stating that he would not be happy inside the Bull of Phalaris and criticizing Stoic Musonius for welcoming adversity.",stoicism
galen,How does the term 'pathos' differ in its ethical connotation between Aristotle's and Galen's views?,"In Aristotle's view, 'pathos' is ethically neutral and refers to emotive or non-rational experience generally. It can be excessive or inadequate, which is why virtues involve finding a mean between these two states. On the other hand, Galen seems to understand 'pathos' in a more negative light, similar to the Stoics, as something undesirable that should be reduced or eliminated as much as possible, rather than finding a balance.",stoicism
happiness,What is the significance of happiness in both Aristotelian and Stoic theories of well-being?,"In both Aristotelian and Stoic theories, happiness is considered important for human well-being. For Aristotelians, happiness is identified with virtuous activity and is seen as a highly pleasant condition that is necessary for well-being. For Stoics, while they regard all but a virtuous inner state as indifferent, unhappiness is still considered unvirtuous and happiness, in the form of tranquility, is seen as entailed by virtue. Additionally, happiness is likely to be a preferred indifferent for Stoics, chosen over unhappiness. However, both theories make clear that happiness alone does not suffice for well-being and that some kinds of happiness can be worthless or even bad.",stoicism
hegel,How did Hegel view the Stoic's conception of the good man?,"Hegel saw the Stoic's conception of the good man as overly abstract and had a critical view of it. He often quoted Cicero's dictum that nobody can say who this sage is, indicating his belief in its lack of clear definition.",stoicism
humor,Why did many Greek philosophers after Plato view laughter and humor negatively?,"Many Greek philosophers after Plato viewed laughter and humor negatively because they associated it with scorn, educated insolence, and a lack of self-control. Aristotle believed that lawgivers should forbid some kinds of jesting, while Stoics like Epictetus advised against loud or frequent laughter, with some followers claiming that he never laughed at all.",stoicism
iamblichus,Who was Iamblichus' teacher and how does Iamblichus relate to Plotinus' philosophy?,"Iamblichus was a student of Porphyry, who was in turn a student of Plotinus. Iamblichus' school was separate from Plotinus' both in time and place, but he accepts and further develops some distinctive features of Plotinus' philosophy. He can be seen as a follower of Plotinus and Porphyry in terms of his general metaphysical and philosophical approach, account of the One and first principles, and exegesis of certain works such as Plato's Parmenides and Aristotle's Categories. However, Iamblichus also has an original position compared to Plotinus and Porphyry in terms of his theories and methods, with this originality becoming particularly apparent in his theories and methods. There is no unitary Neoplatonic school in Late Antiquity, but rather a multifaceted philosophical movement that includes several schools scattered throughout the Roman Empire that shared doctrines and methods to varying degrees. The situation is therefore different from that of ancient Stoicism, which had institutional continuity between its various phases.",stoicism

concept-emotion-india,Why have some philosophers advocated for the control or extinction of emotions?,"Some philosophers have advocated for the control or extinction of emotions because they view emotions as non-rational and as an obstacle to rational thought. They believe that emotions, which can interfere with representational (object-directed) thinking, arise due to physical imbalances in the body and can negatively influence rational thought. The Stoics, for example, have tried to uncover the cognitive element of emotions by advocating for its separation from the affect, with the goal of purging the emotion of its affective component in order to transform it into a purely cognitive state.",stoicism

insolubles,What is the meaning of the term 'transcasus' in Stoic logic?,"In Stoic logic, propositions that change their truth value over time were called metapiptonta in Greek, and 'transcasus' is a literal translation of this term into Latin.

intentionality-ancient,What is one strategy that ancient philosophers employed to reconcile the inconsistency between thought being a direct relation to what is thought about and thought consisting in mental states that do not require what is thought about to exist?,"One strategy that ancient philosophers employed to reconcile this inconsistency was to retain the direct relational model between thought and what is thought about, while also preserving the phenomenological intuition that mental states can exist without what is thought about necessarily existing. The Stoics, for instance, proposed that there are things that do not exist or obtain, which can serve as intentional objects of thought and other mental states. In this way, mental states can still have content without requiring the existence of what is thought about.",stoicism

intentionality-ancient,What is the view of Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes of Assos regarding Plato's forms?,"Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes of Assos argue that there are no such things as Plato's forms. They hold that the concept (ennoia) of a kind is a thought of an ennoēma, an object that is only found in thought. These objects are said to be only ""as if"" they were something and ""as if"" they were qualified, and are often considered fictions or figments that do not even count as something. However, this interpretation raises questions about the coherence of the Stoic view and the nature of these objects.",stoicism
intentionality-ancient,What is the Stoic's view on Platonic forms according to the mentioned text?,"According to the text, the Stoics do not believe that Platonic forms exist or obtain; instead, they believe that there are such things as ennoēmata, which are not actual existents but serve as objects of thought, similar to the impression of something that does not exist, such as a horse when none is present.",stoicism
intentionality-ancient,What are lekta according to Stoic philosophers?,"According to Stoic philosophers, lekta are certain abstract objects that are signified by our words and cannot themselves either act or be acted upon. They are classified as incorporeals, which means they cannot exist as bodies, but they can subsist. Lekta serve as the contents of mental states, which can be articulated in language, regardless of which objects (if any) these states are directed towards.",stoicism
intentionality-ancient,What do Stoics define as the content of mental representations (phantasiai)?,"According to Stoics, lekta constitute the content of mental representations (phantasiai), which they define as ""what subsists in correspondence with a rational representation,"" where a rational representation is one that belongs to rational animals like ourselves.",stoicism
intentionality-ancient,"What is the Stoic view on when reason emerges in humans, and do they believe that nonrational animals have representations with content?","The Stoics believe that reason emerges in humans at a later stage, either at age seven or fourteen, after sufficient concepts have been acquired and systematized. They also acknowledge that some concepts in humans are formed naturally from perceptions and memories alone, unaided by reason. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that they would also believe that nonrational animals have representations with content, at least for perceptual representations, since it would be inconsistent to deny it based on their overall viewpoint",stoicism
intentionality-ancient,What do the Stoics believe about lekta and their involvement in causal interactions?,"The Stoics believe that lekta are involved in every causal interaction, where the lekton specifies the fully determinate effect of the agent on the patient.

kant-religion,"What is the ""Conundrum"" objection that critics raise against Kant's views on Original Sin and moral worth, and how does Andrew Chignell propose that Kant can resolve this issue?","The ""Conundrum"" objection is a criticism that Kant's acceptance of both the Augustinian conception of Original Sin and his so-called ""Stoic Maxim"" of moral worth determined entirely by oneself leads to an inconsistency. Critics argue that this leaves no room for divine aid in moral improvement. Andrew Chignell proposes that Kant can resolve this issue by appealing to hope, as hope is rationally permissible in the face of a (seeming) impossibility so long as it does not rise to an impossibility of ""the most fundamental modal level."" This allows Kant to acknowledge the need for divine aid in moral improvement while maintaining his Stoic Maxim of moral worth determined entirely by oneself, even if it can only be achieved through hope.",stoicism

They believe that reason can help us conquer these harmful emotions and that we should strive to eliminate emotions such as deception, patriotism, and pity for the misfortunes of others as they only bring us harm.",stoicism
justus-lipsius,What was the result of Lipsius's adaptation of Stoic apatheia and fate into Christian terms?,The result of Lipsius's adaptation of Stoic apatheia (emotionlessness) as an appropriate antidote to the religious and political passions of his day and of his transformation of Stoic fate into Christian divine providence was that his brand of Neostoicism became as suitable for Christians as the Aristotelianism of Thomas Aquinas and the Platonism of Marsilio Ficino.,stoicism

logic-ancient,What is the Stoic view on the truth-value of assertibles?,"The Stoics believed that assertibles have a truth-value at any one time, and that truth is temporal, meaning it can change over time. They also held a deflationist view of truth, identifying true assertibles with facts and defining false assertibles as the contradictories of true ones.",stoicism
logic-ancient,How did the Stoics analyze the negation of simple assertibles?,"The Stoics analyzed the negation of simple assertibles in a Russellian manner as 'Both the subject exists and not: the subject has the property expressed by the predicate'. For example, the negation of 'Dion is walking' would be analyzed as 'Both Dion exists and not: Dion is walking'.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What was the primary focus of the Stoics in the field of logic?,"The Stoics developed a propositional logic, which is a system of deduction in which the smallest substantial unanalyzed expressions are propositions or assertibles.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What is the definition of non-simple assertibles in Stoicism and what are the different types of non-simple assertibles that feature in Stoic syllogistic?,"Non-simple assertibles in Stoicism are defined as assertibles that either consist of more than one assertible or of one assertible taken more than once, and that are controlled by a connective particle. There are three types of non-simple assertibles that feature in Stoic syllogistic: conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals. Conjunctions are non-simple assertibles put together by the conjunctive connective 'both ... and ...' and have two conjuncts. Disjunctions are non-simple assertibles put together by the disjunctive connective 'either ... or ... or ...' and have two or more disjuncts, all on a par. Conditionals are non-simple assertibles formed with the connective 'if ..., ...' and consist of antecedent and consequent. The type of assertible an assertible is, is determined by the connective or logical particle that controls it, i.e. that has the largest scope.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What is the nature of Stoic disjunction with regards to truth functionality and exclusivity?,"Stoic disjunction is exclusive and non-truth-functional, meaning it is true when necessarily precisely one of its disjuncts is true. Later Stoics introduced an inclusive disjunction which is non-truth-functional as well.",stoicism
logic-ancient,How does a Stoic argument differ from an argument mode?,"A Stoic argument consists of at least two premises and a conclusion, while an argument mode is a schema of an argument where ordinal numbers take the place of assertibles. The mode of an argument differs from the argument itself by providing a general structure that can be instantiated with any content.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What is the second indemonstrable that follows upon assertion in the Stoic logic system?,The second indemonstrable that follows upon assertion in the Stoic logic system is argument based on hypothetical syllogism.,stoicism
logic-ancient,What is a defining feature of a syllogistic mode in Stoic logic?,"In Stoic logic, a mode is syllogistic if it corresponds to a syllogism in form. This means that if an argument has the same form as the mode in question, then it is a syllogism by virtue of that form.",stoicism
logic-ancient,"How many modes do the Stoics' five meta-linguistic descriptions of indemonstrables correspond to, if complex arguments are disregarded?","If complex arguments are disregarded, there are thirty-two modes that correspond to the five meta-linguistic descriptions of indemonstrables used by the Stoics.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What is a Stoic reduction used for in the context of Stoic logic?,A Stoic reduction is used to demonstrate the formal validity of an argument by transforming it into one or more indemonstrable arguments using the themata in one or more steps. This can be done either with the arguments themselves or their modes.,stoicism
logic-ancient,How can the number of indemonstrables in Stoic logic be reduced according to the text?,The number of indemonstrables in Stoic logic can be reduced to two modes of a second and a third indemonstrable according to the text.,stoicism
logic-ancient,How does a conclusion about the falsity of one assertible follow from the combination of two conditional assertibles and one external assertible according to the three indemonstrables of Stoic logic?,"In Stoic logic, when two assertibles of the form 'If the 1st and the 2nd, the 3rd' and 'But not the 3rd' are given, and a third follows 'Not: both the 1st and the 2nd' (by the second indemonstrable), and from this third assertible and an external assertible 'The 1st' another follows 'Not: the 2nd' (by the third indemonstrable), then this other 'Not: the 2nd' also follows from the two initial assertibles and the external assertible according to the three indemonstrables of Stoic logic.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What was the opinion of the Peripatetics regarding the Stoics' acceptance of reduced arguments?,The Peripatetics criticized the Stoics for allowing arguments that they considered to be useless when those arguments could be reduced.,stoicism
logic-ancient,What logical principles did the Stoics accept in their propositional logic system?,"The Stoics accepted several logical principles in their propositional logic system, including the principle of double negation, the principle of identity for conditionals, the principle of bivalence for two-place disjunctions, and the principle of contraposition.",stoicism
logic-ancient,"How did Chrysippus propose to resolve the Liar paradox, according to the Stoics?","Chrysippus attempted to solve the Liar paradox by positing an ineliminable ambiguity in the Liar sentence between two assertibles, only one of which can be true at any given time. He maintained that bivalence is preserved because the assertibles are incompatible with each other, and each entails a different negation of the other. This approach allowed Chrysippus to uphold the principle of bivalence while also accounting for the paradoxical nature of the Liar sentence.",stoicism
logic-ancient,What were the views of the Epicureans regarding truth-bearers?,"The Epicureans denied the existence of incorporeal meanings, such as Stoic sayables. They held that truth-bearers are linguistic items, specifically, utterances (phônai). Truth consists in the correspondence of things and utterances, while falsehood consists in a lack of such correspondence.",stoicism
logic-ancient,Who were at least two Stoics in the period that wrote a work on Aristotle’s Categories?,"At least two Stoics in this period who wrote a work on Aristotle’s Categories were those whose writings were known to Galen. However, their names are not specified in the provided text.",stoicism
logic-ancient,When did Stoic logic cease to be studied and when was it rediscovered?,"Stoic logic faded into oblivion at some point between the 3rd and 6th century CE and it was not rediscovered until the 20th century, following the (re)-discovery of propositional logic.",stoicism

logical-form,How can we treat the valid form in (9) as derived from more basic Stoic inference forms?,"We can treat (9) as derived from two more basic Stoic inference forms by showing that any instance of this form is valid given these two inference forms: if the first then the second, and the first, so the second; either not the first or not the second, and the first; so not the second. For example, given the premises A and if A, then either not-A or not-B, we can first infer that either not-A or not-B, and then infer not-B, since we were given A.",stoicism
logical-truth,What do philosophers who accept the idea of formality consider the logical form of a sentence to be?,"Philosophers who accept the idea of formality consider the logical form of a sentence to be a certain schema in which the expressions that are not schematic letters are widely applicable across different areas of discourse. If the schema is the form of a logical truth, all of its replacement instances are logical truths. The idea that logic is especially concerned with (replacement instances of) schemata is evident beginning with Aristotle and the Stoics, in all of whom the word usually translated by “figure” is precisely schema.",stoicism
lucretius,Why might it be more accurate to consider Lucretius as philosophically isolated rather than part of a trend among the Roman intelligentsia during his time?,"Lucretius might be considered philosophically isolated because his poem shows few signs of contemporary philosophical or scientific engagement, despite his knowledge of recent trends in Epicurean school and sophisticated debates with other schools like Stoics. Moreover, his critiques of anonymous opponents do not seem to target anyone who lived between Epicurus' own lifetime and Lucretius', including prominent figures from prestigious schools such as the Stoa.",stoicism
lukasiewicz,How did Jan Łukasiewicz initially express his groundbreaking view on Stoic logic?,"Jan Łukasiewicz first voiced his view that Stoic logic was an early propositional logic at a meeting in Lwów in 1923, which contradicted the then standard opinion that it was a defective Aristotelian syllogistic.",stoicism

marcus-aurelius,What is the general agreement among scholars about the purpose of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations?,"Scholars generally agree that Marcus Aurelius wrote Meditations for his own moral improvement, to remind himself of and render concrete the Stoic doctrines he wanted to live by, such as the belief in Providence, happiness lying in virtue, and regarding others as siblings. This is based on the work's genre, its early descriptions as precepts, directing, writings to himself, as well as Epictetus' advice on daily writing and rehearsal for moral improvement.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,"What is the purpose of Marcus Aurelius in writing Meditations, as inferred from its style and content?","Marcus Aurelius wrote Meditations to mentally equip himself to deal with what comes his way, as evidenced by its aphoristic and sloganeering style, lack of specificity in referring to events in his life, use of Stoic terminology without explanation, collection of sayings from various philosophical systems, and the presence of personal faults he aims to combat or correct attitudes he tries to inculcate in his writings. Thus, the reader should approach each assertion in Meditations by studying its 'therapeutic' context and asking what moral and psychological effects Marcus is trying to achieve by saying it.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What is the main focus of the article's examination of Stoicism as a way of life according to Hadot's idea?,"The main focus of the article is on the basic question of what a Stoic uses to guide his own conduct, specifically in relation to the two virtues that Marcus Aurelius has the most to say about: justice and piety. The article does not aim to cover all the themes in Marcus' Meditations regarding Stoic life, but rather concentrates on these particular aspects of Stoicism as a way of life.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,"What does Marcus Aurelius encourage himself to do in Stoic terms, despite finding it challenging?","Marcus Aurelius encourages himself to live as a philosopher, outlining what it entails in Stoic terms.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What is the common goal indicated by various Stoic philosophers regarding living well?,"The common goal indicated by various Stoic philosophers regarding living well is to act in accordance with nature, and to be in a certain cognitive state in relation to one's acts according to nature, such as in agreement, on the basis of experience, being reasonable, consistently, and with understanding.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,Why do Stoics believe that it is important to make distinctions among indifferent things?,"Stoics believe that it is important to make distinctions among indifferent things because if everything were absolutely indifferent, the exercise of wisdom by the Stoic sage would have no function to carry out. By making such distinctions, the sage is able to rationally choose certain indifferent things over others in a way that is in accordance with nature.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What does the term 'appropriate action' (kathêkonta) refer to in Stoic philosophy?,"In Stoic philosophy, an 'appropriate action' (kathêkonta) refers to an action that is in accordance with nature and has a reasonable justification. It is an action that is virtuous when performed from understanding by a fully virtuous person.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What might be the role of knowing preferred indifferents in Stoicism if it doesn't guarantee appropriate actions?,"In Stoicism, knowing preferred indifferents might play a role similar to Ross's identification of prima facie duties in moral decision-making, making certain considerations salient to deliberation without specifying how to weigh indifferents against each other in a particular situation. Alternatively, knowledge of preferred indifferents might provide epistemic reasons rather than practical reasons for selection based on some intrinsic value of the indifferents. This suggests that knowing preferred indifferents might not directly determine appropriate actions but still influence an agent's deliberation and decision-making process.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,Can the appropriateness of some actions be independent of circumstances in Stoic philosophy?,"Yes, in Stoic philosophy, the appropriateness of some actions can be independent of circumstances. According to Diogenes Laertius, there is a distinction between appropriate actions that do not depend on circumstances, such as looking after one's health and sense-organs, and appropriate actions that are appropriate only in certain circumstances. This implies that some aspects of nature, such as health, strength, and well-functioning sense organs, have an intrinsic character that is unconditionally in accordance with their species' nature, not depending on external circumstances.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What is the Stoic doctrine that explains our natural tendency to care for others?,"The Stoic doctrine of oikeiôsis is the idea that we have a natural tendency to care for others, starting with our family and friends and ultimately extending to our fellow-citizens and fellow-humans.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What is the concept that Stoics will respond to a hungry person with food despite their belief that food is not a good?,"The concept is that of intermediate things (tôn mesôn) in Stoicism, where Stoics recognize that certain actions can still be taken in response to circumstances even if those circumstances do not align with their philosophical beliefs about goods and evils. In this case, food is considered an intermediate thing that can be provided to alleviate hunger, regardless of its status as a good in Stoic philosophy.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What attitude towards every part of the cosmos does Marcus advocate based on his belief in its providential design?,"Marcus advocates an attitude of acceptance or love towards every part of the cosmos based on his belief in its providential design and that it is as good as it can be. He distinguishes impulse from desire, restricting impulse to our activity and desire to our passivity, which means we should desire whatever befalls us. This is because our reactions to what befalls us are also impulses, and desire is a species of impulse according to Stoic philosophy. Marcus recommends not desiring but welcoming whatever befalls one, which is associated with contentment upon receiving.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What could be the reasons for Marcus to lay out the alternatives of providence versus atoms in the Meditations?,"Marcus could be laying out these alternatives because he may have a tenuous grasp of Stoic physics and wants to keep an open mind about Epicurean physics being true (Rist 1982, 43, Annas 2004, 116). Alternatively, his intention could be to emphasize that whether one's physics is Epicurean or Stoic, one must live rationally and in accordance with Stoic ethics (Annas, 108–114, Hadot, 148), thus highlighting the convergence of the two schools' ethical views in spite of their differing physical opinions, which could strengthen his confidence in the ethics (Annas, 109).",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,Why might Marcus Aurelius be expressing hesitation about his understanding of Stoic physics?,"Marcus Aurelius might be expressing hesitation about his understanding of Stoic physics because he feels his technical grasp of the subject is inadequate, rather than because he lacks confidence in its superiority over Epicurean physics. This is indicated by his repeated assertions that the world is governed by an intelligent nature, of which he is a functional part.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,"Why might someone like Marcus, who is not fully virtuous according to Stoicism, have reasons that are weaker and less plausible than Stoic arguments but still important to have at hand?","According to Stoicism, the beliefs of anyone other than a wise and fully virtuous person are weak and unstable, as they are not anchored in an understanding of the whole. Therefore, someone like Marcus might have 'back-up' arguments that serve as weaker reasons but are still important to have at hand for moments of weakness or doubt. This is similar to relying on non-ideal reasons (e.g., 'it gives you wrinkles') when ideal reasons (e.g., 'it gives you cancer') may not be sufficiently compelling on their own to maintain one's convictions.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,What is the Stoic view on assent to impressions and how does Marcus Aurelius' instruction to 'erase' impressions relate to this view?,"According to Stoic epistemology, assent to impressions is voluntary and represents judgments, while impressions themselves are not. The Stoics believe that the wise person does not assent except to 'kataleptic' impressions that accurately represent their cause in the world. Marcus Aurelius' instruction to 'erase' impressions may be related to this standard, possibly suggesting that one should withhold assent from non-kataleptic impressions in order to achieve tranquility and clarity of mind. However, it is important to note that this is an interpretation of the text and there may be other possible explanations as well.",stoicism
marcus-aurelius,"How does Marcus Aurelius recommend treating 'good' and 'bad' judgments, according to Stoicism?","Marcus Aurelius recommends refraining from judging 'good' or 'bad' since those describe only virtue and vice, and only the fully virtuous person really knows those in Stoicism. Instead, Marcus often deals with things that are conventionally accorded high value in reductive material terms.",stoicism
medieval-philosophy,What is one of the key ideas of Stoicism regarding emotions?,"Stoicism holds that we can achieve tranquility by understanding that we lack control over many aspects of life and focusing on what we can control, including our emotions, by not letting them be swayed by external events beyond our control.",stoicism

mental-disorder,"What is the link between vices, virtues, and psychic unity in ancient philosophical accounts of mental health?","In ancient philosophical accounts, psychic unity is associated with virtue and rationality, while disunity is associated with vices and irrationality. This link between mental health, rationality, and virtue is present in Aristotle's analysis of the soul and is also characteristic of Stoic accounts, with disunity being seen as a sign of mental illness. This conception of mental illness as psychic disunity is present in later philosophical traditions, such as Spinoza's, and in some present-day disorder descriptions, such as those related to addictions and bipolarity. However, not all personality disorders can be persuasively depicted in terms of psychic disunity.",stoicism

philosophy-mexico,Who is Juana Inés de la Cruz and why is she significant in philosophical discussions?,"Juana Inés de la Cruz was a world-renowned scholar and writer who lived in Mexico in the 17th century. Although she was not a philosopher by trade, her writings contain elements of philosophy including stoicism, hermeticism, and post-Cartesian philosophy. She is particularly known for her long poem Primero sueño which is an erudite reflection on epistemology and theology based on classical and contemporary works. Additionally, she is considered an early feminist who critiqued the unfavorable conditions under which women were forced to produce their own philosophy. Her famous quote ""if Aristotle would have been a cook, he would have written even more"" highlights her belief that men and women should be allowed to develop fully under the same conditions.",stoicism
moral-sentimentalism,"What is the Stoics' view on ordinary emotions, according to their value theory?","According to Stoic value theory, only virtue is good (and only vice bad), while worldly things like illness or social success are indifferent. Since ordinary emotions such as sadness, anger, and love involve judgments about the badness or goodness of worldly things that are really indifferent, they are false evaluative judgments or impressions to assent to false judgments.",stoicism
thomas-more,What is the Utopians' view on human happiness and what philosophical schools does it seem to be influenced by?,"The Utopians believe that pleasure is the most important ingredient of human happiness, which is a view that reflects a classical synthesis of Stoic and Epicurean teachings. They define virtue as a life in accord with nature, which has Stoic overtones, but they emphasize pleasure, which echoes Epicurean teachings. However, their theory of pleasure is based on the supremacy of spiritual pleasure, which has similarities with Plato's ideas.",stoicism
negation,"What is negation considered as in Aristotle's term logic, and how does it differ from the negation connective in Stoic and Fregean logic?","In Aristotle's term logic, negation is considered as a mode of predication that results in wide-scope negation, which is opposed in truth value to the corresponding affirmative. This is distinct from the unary ""it is not the case that"" connective found in Stoic and Fregean logic. In Aristotle's logic, negation is closely tied to predication, while in Stoic and Fregean logic, negation is a connective that operates on entire sentences or propositions.",stoicism
negation,"Who among the Stoics and Aristotelians did the Stoics follow in their definition of negation as an iterating external operator, contrasting with Alexander of Aphrodisias' view of negation?","The Stoics defined negation (apophatikon) as an iterating external operator, contrasting with Alexander of Aphrodisias' view that ""Not: not: it is day differs from it is day only in manner of speech."" This shows that the Stoics followed their own definition of negation rather than Alexander of Aphrodisias' definition. Additionally, the Stoics' use of propositional connectives and a one-place truth/falsity-toggling negation operator prefigured modern propositional logic as well as traditional grammar and the Law of Double Negation, further differentiating their approach from that of Aristotle and his followers.",stoicism
neoplatonism,"Why is the term ""Neoplatonism"" considered a misnomer by some scholars?","The term ""Neoplatonism"" is considered a misnomer because the philosophers who fall under this category did not view themselves as engaging in an effort specifically to revive Plato's thought. Instead, they undertook a grand synthesis of the entire Hellenic intellectual heritage, including Plato, Aristotle, Stoic ethics, literature, myth, and religious practice. They rejected Epicureanism and thoroughgoing corporealism of the Stoics, while respecting the writings of their predecessors and offering a kind of meta-discourse on the sum-total of ideas produced over centuries of sustained inquiry into the human condition.",stoicism
neoplatonism,Who are some of the philosophers that influenced Plotinus' philosophical system?,"Plotinus was influenced by Plato, Aristotle, Stoic ethics, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Middle Platonists (especially Numenius of Apamea), Gnosticism, Hermes Trismegistus, and possibly early Christianity.",stoicism
nietzsche-moral-political,"What is the common theme that underlies Nietzsche's criticisms of various norms such as altruism, happiness, pity, etc.?","Nietzsche's criticisms of various norms such as altruism, happiness, pity, etc., are unified by his belief that a culture that embraces these norms as morality would undermine the conditions necessary for the realization of human excellence, which, in his view, requires concern with the self, suffering, a certain stoic indifference, a sense of hierarchy and difference, and the like.",stoicism
pacifism,Can a non-religious form of virtue-pacifism be developed?,"Yes, it is possible to develop a non-religious form of virtue-pacifism. In ancient times, some versions of Stoicism and Epicureanism came close to this by emphasizing virtues essential for reigning in hubris. The roots of nonviolent social protest can be traced back to Socrates' nonresistance to the Athenian state.",stoicism
pantheism,What is one ancient form of pantheism that considers only bodies as truly existent and understands soul as a specific form of pneuma?,"The Stoics practiced a form of pantheism where they believed physical conceptions were adequate to explain the entire cosmos, and they considered only bodies to be truly existent, with soul being understood as a specific form of pneuma, or breath, the active power to be found throughout nature.",stoicism

philodemus,Who does Philodemus often quote and then refute in his works?,"In his works, Philodemus often quotes and then refutes Stoic philosophers, such as Diogenes of Babylon in On Music IV, as well as literary theorists, such as Crates of Mallos and other critics in On Poems I.",stoicism
philodemus,What is the focus of the treatise on the senses attributed to Philodemus?,"The focus of the treatise on the senses attributed to Philodemus is on the Epicurean theory of perception, including developments of the theory due to the confrontation with Stoics and Aristotelians, specifically the unity of sensation and the 'common sense', as well as the rejection of Stoic 'grasping' (katalêpsis) based on the Epicurean theory of 'affection' (pathos).",stoicism
philo,"How did Philo, a Jewish thinker, feel about the Stoic conception of a perfectly organized world?","Philo, as a Jewish thinker, couldn't refuse the Stoic conception of a perfectly organized world. He even acknowledged the debt he owed to Stoicism due to its influence on his thinking and its status as a lingua franca of intellectual discourse. However, he was also aware of the unbridgeable gap between Stoicism and his own spiritual identity due to its refusal of transcendence. Philo always maintained differences between his own doctrines and those of the Stoics, despite their similarities.",stoicism
philo,How does the Stoic concept of logos differ from Philo's concept in terms of what they represent?,"For the Stoics, logos represents both individual reason and universal reason, nature, and God, while for Philo, logos corresponds to his specific doctrine of the dunameis, the powers of God who created and governs the world, but it is not ultimate reality but merely what we can see and understand of God, who is Himself very far from human comprehension.",stoicism
philo,What is the relationship between Stoic natural law and particular human laws?,"According to Stoic philosophers, there is no particular human law that corresponds directly with natural law. Instead, natural law functions as a universal logos that commands what must be done or avoided.",stoicism
philo,"What can be inferred about Philo's potential conversion to Stoicism based on his usage of the term ""prokoptôn""?","The fact that Philo only uses the term ""prokoptôn"" as an exegetic tool can be interpreted as an argument against the thesis of a late conversion to Stoicism, suggesting that he did not fully embrace Stoic ethical ideas.",stoicism
philo,How does Philo manage to avoid contradictions between Platonic dualism and Stoic monistic doctrine in his psychological commentaries?,"Philo manages to avoid contradictions between Platonic dualism and Stoic monistic doctrine in his psychological commentaries by using two levels of argumentation. He invokes Platonic dualism when discussing the metaphysical and ethical aspects of the soul's relationship with the body and the world. At the same time, he uses Stoic psychological descriptions when discussing the various mental activities in a more functionalist manner. By keeping these two levels distinct, Philo can reconcile seemingly contradictory doctrines without directly addressing their inconsistencies.",stoicism
philo,Who are the fusikoi that Philo evokes in his use of allegory and what is their probable background?,"The fusikoi that Philo evokes in his use of allegory were probably Jewish exegetes who used Stoic methods in interpreting Biblical difficulties. They likely had a strong background in etymology, which was an essential aspect of Stoic allegory at that time. However, according to Long (1992), there is a significant difference between Stoic allegory and Philo's allegories.",stoicism
philo,"What is the psychological meaning of the term ""dunamis"" according to Philo?","In Philo's works, ""dunamis"" has a psychological meaning in addition to its metaphysical sense. It is used to describe the division of the soul in both Aristotelian and Stoic contexts. For instance, at Opif. 67, Philo discusses the division of the soul in a way that combines Aristotelian and Stoic ideas. In Leg. 1.11, he presents a more clearly Stoic division of the soul into seven traditional parts (the five senses, reproduction, and speech). Furthermore, Philo appears to adopt a dualistic position, distinguishing between a rational and irrational part of the soul.",stoicism
philo,What is the role of the logos in Philo's interpretation of the Stoic system in Leg. 3.175-6?,"In Philo's interpretation of the Stoic system in Leg. 3.175-6, the logos is defined as the ""ti"", which is the all-encompassing genus. It is described as the supreme genus of everything that was born and serves as the instrument by which God created the world, or in anthropomorphic terms, His ""first-born son"" or His deputy.",stoicism
philo,What does Philo believe about the relationship between living according to nature and following God?,"In Philo's thought, living according to nature is only valid if it is followed by a reference to God, who is transcendent by definition. He uses the Stoic formula of living according to nature to mean following God, but for him, these two phrases are not synonymous in the way that they are for Stoics.",stoicism
philo,What is the concept in Philo's work that is most closely related to the Stoic idea of spermatikoi logoi?,"In Philo's work, the concept that is most closely related to the Stoic idea of spermatikoi logoi is that of the divine logos as a sower of rational patterns inherent in the principles of organization of the world.",stoicism
philo,How does Philo understand the relationship between the logos and the law of Nature compared to the Stoics?,"Philo perceives the logos and the law of Nature as distinct, whereas for the Stoics, they are perfectly synonymous. Philo refers to the law as ""the right reason of nature,"" indicating a difference in perspective despite using Stoic vocabulary. Furthermore, Philo considers the Torah as unique and concrete law for the people of Israel, sometimes equating it with the Natural Law and other times viewing it as an image of it, causing controversy in determining whether this means ontological degradation or perfect identity.",stoicism
philo,"What is Philo's intense fear that is sometimes compared to Stoicism and is also referred to as the ""Chaldean temptation""?","Philo has an intense fear of people attributing the movement of celestial bodies as the cause of everything, which has been called the ""Chaldean temptation."" This fear is similar to Stoicism in some ways.",stoicism
philo,How does Philo's use of different metaphors and images reflect his approach to understanding the soul?,"Philo uses a variety of metaphors and images to understand the soul, such as the puppet master pulling strings, a source and stream, and Stoic definitions of living beings. His approach is not to provide a single, definitive explanation of what the soul is, but rather to use these different images and ideas to deepen his understanding of human nature and the meaning of the word of the Lord. Philo is aware of his own ignorance in the field of psychology, but views this as an opportunity to better perceive the limitations inherent to human nature, rather than an obstacle to understanding.",stoicism
philo,"How does Philo of Alexandria understand the concept of oikeiôsis, in contrast to its Stoic meaning?","Philo of Alexandria reinterprets the concept of oikeiôsis, which in Stoicism refers to natural kinship, as a spiritual kinship with God achieved through pious asceticism, eliminating desire and passionate impulses. This results in an emphasis on resemblance to God (omoiôsis), which does not necessarily have concrete social or ethical consequences according to some scholars but plays an essential role in Philo's thought, especially in the context of Israel's unique relationship with God as the priest of the Nations and its capacity to articulate individual, social, and ontological perfection.",stoicism
philo,How does Philo reinterpret the Stoic division of passions in his philosophical approach?,"Philo introduces hope and repentance, which are biblical virtues, as good passions in his allegorical interpretation of Stoic doctrine. This change signifies a deep ontological shift from Stoic psychology to transcendentalist ethics, as Philo does not entirely abandon controlling bad passions but rather opens a path that goes beyond mere psychological aspects.",stoicism
philo,What is the attitude of Philo towards passions in relation to Stoicism and how does he differ in his approach to apatheia?,"Philo shares some similarities with Stoicism in his attitude towards passions, emphasizing the importance of self-control (enkrateia) and endurance (karteria) in dealing with them. However, he fundamentally differs in that he believes divine Grace is necessary to become free from passions. In contrast to Stoicism's belief that the sage cannot lose his perfection, Philo argues that human beings can transform bad passions into good ones through submission to God's power. He also differs from Stoicism in his approach to apatheia (perfect serenity); whereas Stoics present it as an ethical heroism, Philo does not, and he affirms that there are no natural limits to human perfectibility when one submits oneself to God's power.",stoicism
philo,"Why is Sarah, in Philo's interpretation, associated with being born from the father of everything?","Sarah is associated with being born from the father of everything because she represents an allegory of virtues that unites with Abraham to give birth to Isaac, who is the allegory of joy, one of the three Stoic good passions (eupatheiai). This association makes her comparable to Athena in her divine origin and nature, despite Philo's otherwise misogynistic views on gender differences.",stoicism
philo,How does Philo view the relationship between human perfection and divine perfection in the Quod omnis probus?,"In the Quod omnis probus, Philo maintains an infinite distance between human perfection and divine perfection, contrary to Stoic doctrine where humans and God share the same nature. According to Philo's interpretation of the Bible, humans are created in God's image but possess limited knowledge about Him due to Philonian negative theology.",stoicism
philo-larissa,Who do Philo's epistemological views align with in their denial of Stoic conceptions of knowledge?,"Philo's epistemological views align with the Academic philosophers, such as Arcesilaus and Carneades, in their denial of Stoic conceptions of knowledge. This is because Philo's views emerged in the context of the century-and-a-half long critique of Stoic epistemology by Academic philosophers.",stoicism
philo-larissa,What is the Stoic definition of belief?,"The Stoics defined the formation of a belief as a matter of assenting to an occurrent thought or impression that something is, or is not, the case.",stoicism
philo-larissa,"What consequence did the Academics draw, based on Stoic principles, about the possibility of knowledge if cognitive impressions cannot be self-warranting?","The Academics argued that if cognitive impressions are not self-warranting, then according to Stoic principles, nothing at all can be known because all knowledge depends on cognitions.",stoicism
philo-larissa,"What is the rational response to impressions, according to the Stoic theory, if there are no cognitive impressions as they define them?","According to the Stoic theory, if there are no cognitive impressions as they define them, it is never rational to assent to any impression.",stoicism
philo-larissa,What was the Stoic objection to the Academics' argument against cognitive impressions that particularly troubled the Academic students of Carneades?,"The Stoic objection that particularly troubled the Academic students of Carneades was the ""inactivity"" objection. This objection argued that if the Academics were right, it would be impossible to act at all, since voluntary action depends on beliefs and thus on assent. But since action (indeed, good action) is possible, the Academics must be mistaken.",stoicism
philo-larissa,Why is it unlikely that Carneades accepted the conclusions of his arguments against Stoic epistemology?,"There are several reasons to doubt that Carneades straightforwardly believed that nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any impression after arguing for these conclusions. First, such a position would be inconsistent since beliefs are assents on the Stoic view. Secondly, Carneades had no reason to accept Stoic assumptions about impressions, empiricism, knowledge, and psychological doctrine. Lastly, Carneades' dialectical method of argument suggests that his arguments were designed to show the inadequacies of Stoic views rather than as an endorsement of skepticism. Additionally, Carneades presented multiple incompatible responses to Stoic reductio arguments, further indicating a critique of Stoic epistemological views.",stoicism
philo-larissa,"How did Clitomachus argue that we can act and have beliefs without assenting to impressions as true or cognitive, as maintained by the Stoics?","Clitomachus drew on Carneades' theory of persuasive (pithanon) impressions, which describe ordinary epistemic procedures as an alternative to the Stoic theory of cognitive impressions. We can increase or diminish the initial persuasiveness of our impressions by considering their internal characteristics, perceptual conditions, and coherence with our other impressions. We accept and act on impressions when they reach an appropriate level of persuasiveness, but this does not guarantee that they are true or cognitive. Clitomachus insisted that we do not assume these procedures establish an impression as true in ordinary life.",stoicism
philo-larissa,What is the distinction made by Clitomachus between assenting and approving an impression?,"Clitomachus distinguished between assenting to an impression, in the Stoic sense of taking it to be true, and approving an impression, in the sense of acting on it or accepting it as if it were true. This distinction allows for discrimination between impressions while preserving the Academic thesis that nothing can be known with certainty.",stoicism
philo-larissa,What is the distinction between the way Stoics and mitigated skeptics understood opinions?,"The Stoics regarded opinions as any assent to a non-cognitive impression, which they considered bad, while mitigated skeptics distinguished rational opinions based on reasons from the Stoic category of opinion. Mitigated skeptics qualified their assent to these opinions as provisional on inconclusive evidence, rather than as a straightforward commitment to their truth.",stoicism
philo-larissa,What belief did the mitigated skeptics hold that indicates their skepticism was heavily dependent on Stoic epistemology?,"The mitigated skeptics believed that nothing can be known, which they accepted on the basis of Academic arguments that were themselves based on Stoic epistemology. This indicates that their skepticism was heavily dependent on Stoic epistemology since they accepted Stoic theories of impressions, Stoic empiricism, Stoic conceptions of knowledge, and so on.",stoicism
philo-larissa,"What was Philo's proposed alternative definition of knowledge of single propositions, according to the information provided about his response in the Roman Books?","Philo's proposed alternative definition of knowledge of single propositions was that an impression is cognitive if it is both true and caused in the appropriate way for correctly representing its object, without requiring that its truth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of representation guaranteed by its causal history (the disputed Stoic rider).",stoicism
plato-ethics-politics,How does the Republic define eudaimonia in relation to virtuous activity?,"The Republic defines eudaimonia as identical to virtuous activity, rather than virtuous activity being a means to achieve eudaimonia. This is evident in the function argument of Book One (354a) and aligns with Aristotle's and Stoics' views of eudaimonia as virtuous activity.",stoicism
pleasure,"How did the Stoics interpret spontaneous pleasure-seeking in infants, according to the text?","The Stoics interpreted spontaneous pleasure-seeking in infants as a by-product of the achievement of other ends, starting right from the infant’s innate impulses toward biological goods such as food, guided by a natural instinct directed toward its preservation. They believed that rational motivation may later supersede these impulses, which were not towards pleasure as an ultimate goal.",stoicism
pleasure,What argument did Joseph Butler put forward to counter the view of human nature as hedonistically selfish?,"Joseph Butler argued that pleasure always consists in the satisfaction of some motive (or 'passion'), and that altruistic motives are thus in principle as capable of leading to a high level of fulfilled desire, and thus of pleasure, as any others. He thereby renewed the Stoic insistence on the priority of motivation to pleasure and the related medieval view that pleasure always consists in the satisfaction of some appetite.",stoicism
pleasure,What is the role of normative wisdom in relation to physiology when it comes to the concept of pleasure?,"Normative wisdom is called for in relation to physiology when it comes to the concept of pleasure, at least in its primary use by naive experiencers, because pleasure is an evaluative and normative concept that fixes its reference through presenting as good to them. This is significant because it brackets scientific and philosophical theories about it. Sidgwick (1907), Stoics, Plato, and Aristotle have all engaged with this idea in their works.",stoicism
plutarch,What is the focus of Plutarch's polemical works against the Stoics?,"Plutarch's polemical works against the Stoics include On the Self-contradictions of the Stoics, On the Common Notions against the Stoics, On the Cleverness of Animals, and On Moral Virtue. These works challenge the views of Stoicism and employ a distinct polemical tone and strategies, often critically engaging with Stoic philosophies in an uncompromising manner.",stoicism
plutarch,What was one of Plutarch's works that discussed Stoic logic?,The Reply to Chrysippus on the First Consequent was one of Plutarch's works that discussed Stoic logic.,stoicism
plutarch,Why does Plutarch reject the ethics of both Stoics and Epicureans?,"Plutarch rejects the ethics of both Stoics and Epicureans because he maintains the existence of an intelligible world, which has shaped the sensible world including humans. He believes that both the human intellect and the human soul stem from the intelligible realm, which shapes our human nature accordingly. This is in contrast to the ethics of Stoics and Epicureans, which he criticizes as misguided.",stoicism
plutarch,Who is Alcinous in the context of ancient Greek philosophy?,"Alcinous is the name of a philosopher associated with the Middle Platonist school of thought in ancient Greece. His work is known for its synthesis of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic ideas.",stoicism
plutarch,Who is the ancient Stoic philosopher known by the mononymous name of “Seneca”?,"Seneca was a prominent Stoic philosopher who was born in Cordoba, Spain in 4 BC and died in 65 AD in Rome, Italy.",stoicism
ancient-political,"Which philosophical schools persisted and which were new during the period under consideration, apart from Epicureanism and Stoicism?","The philosophical schools that persisted included the Platonic Academy, which had been transformed in a skeptical direction, and the Aristotelian Lyceum, also known as the Peripatetic School. The newcomers were the Cynics and the Pyrrhonist skeptics, both of which traced their understanding back to the figure of Socrates.",stoicism
ancient-political,What was the Stoic view on the role of the sage in politics and what factors influenced their political engagement?,"The Stoic view on the role of the sage in politics was that they would engage in politics unless prevented by something. This commitment to politics was generally seen as part of nature's rational plan for human happiness, and was influenced by various factors such as existing laws, natural law, and the idea of a city. However, there was debate among Stoic figures about whether the members of this city were to be all humans together with the gods, only human sages and the gods, or something else entirely. Similarly, there was debate about whether the city in question was to be a distinct foundation or identical with the cosmos, and how the law of a particular city related to natural law.",stoicism
ancient-political,What is the main idea behind Zeno's Republic regarding human conduct in relation to cosmic order?,"Zeno's Republic presents the Stoic idea of natural law, which harmonizes human conduct with cosmic order. It also incorporates a classical vision of politics with Platonic ideals of friendship through communist and sexual bonding. Zeno endorses Plato's prescription of community of women and children, and emphasizes civic equality of men and women based on their shared characteristics and tendencies with other animals. Humans are driven by a social tendency to associate with those similar to themselves (oikeiôsis), forming societies not strictly for political reasons but as a social impulse.",stoicism
ancient-political,How did the Stoics view existing cities in relation to political action?,"The Stoics viewed existing cities as an accepted arena for political action in practice, with Stoic sages and scholars advising kings and serving in offices. This was because the notion of a distinctive individual city remained the principal framework for defining the nature of politics in terms of justice.",stoicism
ancient-political,Why were Roman aristocrats particularly drawn to Stoicism?,"Roman aristocrats were drawn to Stoicism because it allowed for the integration of scholarly pursuits with political and kingly lives, aligning with their republican values and their reverence for ancestral customs and traditions.",stoicism
ancient-political,Which two Greek philosophers had a significant influence on Cicero's political writings?,"Plato and the Stoics, particularly Posidonius, Panaetius, and (possibly) Diodotus, had a significant influence on Cicero's political writings. Cicero emphasized Stoic themes such as the natural affinity for society and the existence of natural law, as well as Platonic themes and models in his dialogues.",stoicism
ancient-political,"What was the political situation that Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, found himself in as a new man made senator?","Seneca, as a new man made senator from Spain, had to navigate the treacherous politics of advising the princeps, who was often surrounded by poisonous power struggles.",stoicism
ancient-political,What does Seneca argue is the relationship between clemency and the Stoic concept of virtue?,"According to Seneca, clemency is a Stoic virtue that is distinct from both crudelitas (cruelty) and misericordia (pity or compassion). He argues that the Stoic sage will exercise clemency by considering the circumstances and causes of a criminal's actions and seeking to improve their character in a measured and discerning way. Seneca also maintains that clemency is valuable in itself and beneficial, as it promotes love in subjects and improves criminals more efficiently than cruelty. However, it is worth noting that while Seneca advocates for clemency towards slaves, his cosmopolitanism did not extend to advocating for their manumission or the abolition of slavery.",stoicism
ancient-political,Who were some of the Stoics who were politically active and became known as 'Stoic martyrs'?,"Some of the Stoics who were politically active and became known as 'Stoic martyrs' include Thrasea Paetus and Barea Soranus under Nero, Helvidius Priscus under Vespasian, and Paconius Agrippinus under Tiberius.",stoicism
ancient-political,Who was Carneades and what was his philosophical contribution?,"Carneades was an ancient Greek skeptic philosopher who founded the Academy's Third Phase in Athens during the middle of the second century BC. He is best known for his criticism of Stoicism and his development of probabilistic arguments in epistemology. Carneades argued that knowledge is impossible, and that all claims to knowledge can only be probable. He also distinguished between two types of belief: assent (or acceptance) and adherence (or commitment). Carneades' philosophical contributions have had a significant impact on the development of skepticism in ancient philosophy.",stoicism
medieval-political,"According to the Cynics and Stoics, is it possible for a slave to achieve virtue and happiness despite their external constraints?","Yes, according to the Cynics and Stoics, it is possible for a slave to attain virtue and happiness, as they believed that the essential freedom of a human being is not incompatible with external constraint.",stoicism
pomponazzi,Which work by Pomponazzi was completed shortly after On Incantations and argues in favor of Stoic deterministic understandings of causation?,"De fato, de libero arbitrio, et de praedestinatione (On Fate, Free Will, and Predestination), a work that Pomponazzi completed shortly after On Incantations in 1520, argues in favor of Stoic deterministic understandings of causation.",stoicism
proclus,"What is the Stoic view on what is capable of acting and being acted upon, according to Steel 2002?","The Stoic view is that only bodies and powers or qualities of bodies are capable of acting and being acted upon, according to Steel 2002.",stoicism
propositions,"Who were the first Western philosophers to use the concept of propositions in a way that is similar to our current understanding, and what did they call these propositions?","The Stoics, including Zeno and Chrysippus, were the first Western philosophers to use the concept of propositions in a way that is similar to our current understanding. They called these propositions axiomata, which were defined as the meanings of declarative sentences. According to the Stoics, only axiomata, and not the words used to articulate them, could be said to be true or false, making them the proper subject matter of Stoic logic.",stoicism
propositions,"What kind of philosophical problem did lekta pose for Stoic materialism, according to Seneca?","Lekta posed a problem for Stoic materialism as they were considered incorporeal entities, which contradicted the Stoic belief that only bodily and corporeal things are real and can act or be acted upon.",stoicism
ancient-soul,What is the role of the soul in Stoic physics according to the theory that suggests the body of an animal contains three kinds of pneuma?,"In Stoic physics, according to this theory, the soul is responsible for specifically mental or psychological functions in animals, such as cognition by sense and intellect (in humans) and desire. It is not responsible for all vital functions, but rather shares those responsibilities with the two other kinds of pneuma: the lowest kind, which accounts for the cohesion and character of inanimate bodies, and the intermediate kind, called natural pneuma, which is in charge of non-mental vital functions such as metabolism and growth. This theory marks a significant departure from the Platonic and Aristotelian view that plants are ensouled organisms, and has played an important role in the history of ideas leading up to the Cartesian conception of mind as separate from the living body.",stoicism
ancient-soul,What is the role of reason in the Stoic theory of the human mind?,"In the Stoic theory of the human mind, reason is what distinguishes adult human minds from those of non-human animals and non-adult humans. Reason allows humans to achieve assent and transform mere impressions and impulses into rational ones. The rationality of an impression consists in its being articulated in terms of concepts, while the rationality of an impulse consists in the fact that it is generated by a voluntary act of assent of the mind to a suitable practical impression. Depending on the type of impression assented to, assent generates belief or knowledge concerning some matter of fact, or an impulse to act in a certain way.",stoicism
ancient-soul,What is the Stoic view on the relationship between reason and desire in adult human beings?,"The Stoic view is that reason and desire are not separate parts of the mind that can conflict with each other in adult human beings. Instead, desire is a product of reason, and all voluntary behavior in a rational subject is the result of reasoned assent. This view leaves no room for non-rational parts or desires that could produce actions against one's own reason's protestations. However, the Stoics had to defend this theory against pre-theoretical intuitions that passion can conflict with reason.",stoicism
ancient-soul,What significant development in Stoic psychological theory is associated with the philosopher Posidonius?,Posidonius introduced into Stoic psychological framework the idea that even the minds of adult humans include motivationally relevant forces that do not depend on assent or reason at all and that are not fully subject to rational control.,stoicism
ancient-soul,What happened to philosophical interest in the soul after the Hellenistic period?,"After the Hellenistic period, there was a revival of interest in the works of Plato and Aristotle in the second half of the second century BCE, which included renewed interest in Platonic and Aristotelian conceptions of the soul. This sparked novel theoretical developments, such as Plotinus' argument against the Stoics that the soul could not be spatially extended. Christian writers such as Clement of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa were also heavily indebted to philosophical theories of the soul but introduced new concerns and interests of their own. All of these post-classical developments need to be interpreted within the framework and context of classical theories of the soul that were developed in detail in the classical period.",stoicism
ramus,Why did the Stoics believe that logic was an integral part of philosophy?,"The Stoics believed that there was a correspondence in the universe between order and reason, and that this reason was essentially the same as human reason. As a result, they held that all arts must be about nature or being, and that there could not be a difference of rank between the parts of nature or between the parts of philosophy. Therefore, they saw logic as an integral part of philosophy rather than just an instrument to be used by the other branches of the discipline.",stoicism
ramus,Why did Ramus often change his attitude towards Aristotle and the Aristotelians?,"Ramus' inconsistency in his attitude towards Aristotle and the Aristotelians was due to his adoption of different strategies in response to different polemical situations. He was influenced by both Aristotelian and Ciceronian and Stoic ideas, and rarely directly attacked Aristotle himself. Instead, he often pointed out differences between Aristotle and his later commentators when there was a clash between the Aristotelian and Stoic way of thinking.",stoicism
ramus,Why is it a misconception to consider Ramus a strict Platonist based on his early writings?,"Ramus's early reliance on a clear metaphysical link between nature, mathematics, and dialectic led some scholars to assume he was influenced by Platonism. However, these Platonic influences were vague and often concealed, and as time went on, they lost importance in his works. Ramus's self-proclaimed Platonism was primarily meant to distance himself from Aristotle and Aristotelians, while his ideas were more often inspired by Cicero and Stoicism. Despite his attacks on Aristotle, Ramus's thought was fundamentally rooted in the scholastic tradition. (Bruyère 1984 argues differently, however.)",stoicism
ramus,How did Ramus define logic according to the Stoic perspective?,"Ramus defined logic as the ars bene disserendi, which means the art of correctly discussing or analyzing something, according to the Stoic perspective.",stoicism
ramus,"What did the Stoics focus on in contrast to the Aristotelians, as described by Cicero?","The Stoics focused on the different aspects of the judgments that we make and analyzing arguments (the ratio disserendi), while the Aristotelians were mainly interested in finding the right arguments (the ars inveniendi).",stoicism
ramus,"Who was Petrus Hispanus, also known as Peter of Spain, and what is he known for in the field of philosophy?","Petrus Hispanus, also known as Peter of Spain, was a Portuguese philosopher and theologian who is best known for his work on medieval theories of syllogism. He made significant contributions to the field of logic and is also known for his writings on other philosophical topics such as skepticism and Stoicism.",stoicism
august-rehberg,What was Rehberg's view on the practical justification of religion?,"Rehberg rejected Kant's solution to the pantheism controversy, which was the concept of practical faith, the defense of religious belief on the basis of practical reason. Instead, he believed that the only practical justification of religion was political - its utility in maintaining order among the people. He affirmed an austere stoic ethic, which demanded acting on duty alone, regardless of personal happiness.",stoicism
francisco-sanches,Why did Galen feel confused about logical proof despite studying under reputed Stoic and Peripatetic philosophers?,"Galen became confused about logical proof because the Stoic and Peripatetic philosophers he studied under held conflicting logical theories, which prevented him from recognizing a sound proof.",stoicism
schema,What must be satisfied for the associated side condition of the Stoic propositional logic schemas?,"The associated side condition of the Stoic propositional logic schemas must be satisfied by ensuring that (1) both occurrences of ‘\(P\)’ are filled with one and the same common noun, (2) both occurrences of ‘\(M\)’ are filled with one and the same common noun other than the one used for ‘\(P\)’, (3) both occurrences of ‘\(S\)’ are filled with one and the same common noun other than the ones used for ‘\(P\)’ and ‘\(M\)’, and that (4) the expression ‘belongs-to-every’ is taken to express universal affirmative predication as in the Prior analytics.",stoicism
schleiermacher,What is the innovation that Schleiermacher made in his conception of moral cosmopolitanism?,"Schleiermacher's innovation in his conception of moral cosmopolitanism is a pluralist form that contrasts with the homogenizing cosmopolitanism of the philosophical tradition, such as the Stoics and Kant, who assumed moral uniformity. This form of moral cosmopolitanism embraces moral diversity rather than trying to eliminate it.",stoicism
seneca,Who is a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period and played a large role in the revival of Stoic ideas in the Renaissance?,Seneca is a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period who made a lasting contribution to Stoicism. His philosophical works played a large role in the revival of Stoic ideas in the Renaissance.,stoicism
seneca,Why is there a debate about whether Seneca's tragedies reflect his Stoic philosophical views?,"The debate arises from the fact that Stoicism values reason and emotional control, while Seneca's tragedies often involve intense emotions and dramatic events. This apparent contradiction has led some scholars to question whether the tragedies can truly be seen as expressions of Stoicism. However, more recent scholarship tends to assume that some of the themes in Seneca's tragedies are at least related to his philosophical views, especially in terms of ethics, psychology, and natural philosophy.",stoicism
seneca,How does Seneca's approach to philosophy manifest in his writing style and focus?,"Seneca writes within an existing philosophical system, which he generally agrees with, rather than building his own theory from scratch. His philosophy exhibits multiple layers, requiring references to earlier Stoic philosophy to provide context. Seneca develops some theories further, while downplaying certain technicalities in others. He highlights the practical and therapeutic aspects of philosophy instead.",stoicism
seneca,How does Seneca view his relationship with Stoicism and other philosophical schools?,"Seneca sees himself as an independent thinker who writes within the Stoic system but is not concerned with keeping Stoicism 'pure' from non-Stoic ideas. He feels free to disagree with earlier Stoics and integrates ideas from other philosophies if they seem helpful to him. He likens philosophical views to motions made in a meeting and is open to splitting them up to agree with one part and disagree with another. Seneca also adopts metaphors or images from other philosophical schools, such as Platonically inspired images of the body as prison of the soul, but this does not necessarily commit him to holding the theories in which they originate.",stoicism
seneca,What is the relationship between philosophy and politics in Seneca's Stoic cosmopolitanism?,"In Seneca's Stoic cosmopolitanism, philosophy and politics represent two worlds that we simultaneously belong to. The world of politics is our local world where we aim to do good to people in our vicinity through an active career in politics. On the other hand, retreating into philosophy allows us to live predominantly in the world at large and help others who are not necessarily spatially close to us through studying, teaching, and writing philosophy (Wildberger 2018a).",stoicism
seneca,Why does Seneca argue that the soul must be a body?,"Seneca argues that the soul must be a body because only bodies can act on anything and cause effects. This is in line with the Stoic view that the soul is corporeal, and it is emphasized in Letter 106.",stoicism
seneca,What is psychological monism in the context of Stoic philosophy?,"Psychological monism in Stoic philosophy is the view that there is no non-rational part or power of the soul. Instead, the soul is one insofar as its commanding faculty is one, and rational. This means that motivational conflict and irrational action do not result from a 'struggle' between the rational and the non-rational aspects of the soul. Instead, what we call irrational must be understood as (bad) states of the rational soul. Psychological monism is a counterposition to Plato’s and Aristotle’s account of the soul, and has major implications for the theory of action, ethics, and the theory of emotion.",stoicism
seneca,Why does Seneca argue that it is not enough to simply study arguments and objections related to the Stoic thesis that virtue alone brings happiness?,"Seneca argues that it is not enough to simply study arguments and objections related to the Stoic thesis that virtue alone brings happiness because one needs to think through the implications of this thesis in a variety of practical contexts, so as then to be able to live by it. He believes that thinking about these issues in the right way must become a way of life.",stoicism
seneca,What is the role of assent in Stoic understanding of human action and virtue?,"In Stoicism, assent is central to human action and virtue. Assenting to practical impressions generates impulse (hormê), which in turn leads to action if there is no external impediment. Since assent is under our control, it is in our power to become virtuous by deciding how we act, as we can choose to assent only to cognitive impressions that represent things precisely as they are.",stoicism
seneca,What is the key piece of Stoic doctrine regarding the relationship between assent and voluntary actions?,"According to Stoic doctrine, whether an individual is foolish or wise, it is within their power to assent or not assent to impressions, which in turn determines whether their actions are voluntary or not.",stoicism
seneca,"What does Veyne suggest about the possibility of using Stoicism, and specifically Seneca's works, for our own purposes even if it may not accurately reflect Stoicism's original meaning?","Veyne suggests that it is acceptable to ""abuse"" Seneca's works and use Stoicism as a philosophy of the active turning in on itself of the self, even if it did not originally have that meaning in its own historical context. He argues that this interpretation can be supported by reading Seneca's Letters in particular.",stoicism
seneca,What is the Stoic concept that involves fully appreciating the way in which everything outside of one's mind belongs to one?,The Stoic concept that involves fully appreciating the way in which everything outside of one's mind belongs to one is called 'oikeiôsis'.,stoicism
seneca,How have scholars interpreted Seneca's treatise On Anger in relation to Stoic psychological monism?,"Scholars have interpreted Seneca's treatise On Anger in two main ways in relation to Stoic psychological monism. Some scholars, such as Sorabji, have argued that Seneca's account of the emotions in On Anger is situated vis-à-vis early and middle Stoic theories that differ from his own. On the other hand, other scholars, such as Cooper and Vogt, have interpreted On Anger as basically in agreement with Stoic psychological monism, appreciating it for its detailed treatment of violent emotions as acts of the rational soul. These different interpretations reflect ongoing debates in Seneca scholarship regarding the consistency and development of Stoic theories of emotion.",stoicism
seneca,What is the Stoic view on the ideal agent's emotional state?,"The Stoic view on the ideal agent's emotional state is one of rational affective reactions and dispositions, rather than emotions. The ideal agent has ""good feelings"" of wishing, caution, and joy, as well as initial affective and physiological reactions that do not depend on assent, often referred to as proto-emotions.",stoicism
seneca,"What type of emotion is anger according to the Stoics, and what judgments are involved in feeling anger?","According to the Stoics, anger is a kind of desire that results in action. It is tied up with irrational action and involves several judgments, starting with 'He wronged me'. This initial judgment then leads to the desire for revenge, which is an impulse towards action if there is no external impediment",stoicism
seneca,"Why does the Stoic sage not experience a negative emotional response, such as deploring or feeling bad about, vice despite recognizing it as bad?","The reason Stoic sage does not experience a negative emotional response to vice is that virtue does not allow for rational negative affective responses, as they would not benefit the individual. Instead, the sage maintains cheerfulness as a form of benefit, giving hope rather than succumbing to distress.",stoicism
seneca,How does Seneca view preferred indifferents in Stoic ethics according to the text?,"According to the text, Seneca views preferred indifferents in Stoic ethics as having value but not being good in the terminological sense. He acknowledges that they can be challenging not to see as contributing to one's happiness but encourages his audience to become less attached to them while still taking care of them.",stoicism
seneca,What is Stoic philosopher Seneca's metaphorical comparison for placing value on indifferents?,"Stoic philosopher Seneca compares placing value on indifferents to preferring one good man over another based solely on his fancy haircut, implying that indifferents hold little significance when compared to genuine virtue. This comparison is used to emphasize that indifferents should not be given real importance in deliberation.",stoicism
seneca,Why did the Stoics write treatises about indifferents if they are not relevant to appropriate action?,"The Stoics wrote treatises about indifferents because they are not completely irrelevant to appropriate action. Indifferents are in fact the material of deliberation in specific situations and courses of action available in them involve indifferents, such as putting on appropriate clothes for a given occasion.",stoicism
seneca,Why have Letters 94 and 95 of Kidd (1978) been particularly relevant in discussions about rules in Stoic ethics?,"Letters 94 and 95 of Kidd (1978) have been relevant in discussions about rules in Stoic ethics because they provide evidence that can be interpreted as Stoics formulating rule-like precepts, which in turn has implications for understanding the Stoic conception of law as potentially consisting of a set of laws.",stoicism
seneca,"What is the role of decreta in Stoic philosophy, according to the provided text?","Decreta in Stoic philosophy refers to the most abstract and fundamental teachings of the Stoics, not practical principles or rules. They are the core tenets of Stoic philosophy that one needs to immerse oneself in to achieve virtue.",stoicism
seneca,What is the role of an advisor in Stoic philosophy according to Seneca's perspective?,"According to Seneca's perspective, an advisor in Stoic philosophy plays a crucial role in reminding individuals of insights such as 'money does not bring happiness' and providing specific advice tailored to particular occasions. The advisor's guidance is not based on strict rules, as situations are constantly changing and require balancing various considerations.",stoicism
seneca,What is the aspect of giving and receiving correctly that Seneca emphasizes in his treatise?,Seneca emphasizes that the relevant actions of giving and receiving correctly are the intention to benefit on the part of the giver and the intention to gratefully repay the favor on the part of the receiver. He argues that it is the act of willing which counts as a correct action in Stoic ethics.,stoicism
seneca,How does Seneca's discussion of benefits in Book 4 of his treatise relate to Stoic ethics and its conception of the good?,"Seneca's discussion of benefits in Book 4 does not rely on quintessentially Stoic assumptions or address the subtleties of Stoic conceptions of the good. Instead, it focuses on concrete problems arising from the exchange of favors in society, such as dependency and feelings of enslavement. The arguments about good deeds in Book 4 are essentially already laid out in Books 1 to 3, establishing that what matters are intentions and attitudes, independent of Stoic premises about the good. The Stoic view that the good and the advantageous are one and the same does not seem to align with Seneca's question about whether benefits ought to be given for their own sake or for the sake of some advantage to the giver in Book 4.",stoicism
seneca,What is the distinction Seneca makes between two types of notions of the good in Stoic ethics?,"Seneca distinguishes between two notions of the good in Stoic ethics. The first is a preconception of the good that human beings have from early on, before understanding any of the truths of Stoic philosophy. The second is a more advanced notion of the good that progressors, those who are making progress in Stoic wisdom, may come to see the point of without yet being fully able to consistently appreciate its truth in their lives. This second notion is the scientific concept of the good, which is only acquired once a human being turns into a wise person and recognizes that only virtue is good.",stoicism
seneca,How does Seneca help his readers understand what Stoics mean by virtue being good without having encountered a real-life instance of virtue?,Seneca uses cognitive operations such as magnifying the virtuous features of agents and minimizing their negative features in accounts of great deeds to help his readers understand what Stoics mean by virtue being good without having encountered a real-life instance of virtue.,stoicism
seneca,Why does Seneca invest time in discussing natural phenomena in the Natural Questions?,"Seneca discusses natural phenomena in the Natural Questions as part of a well-established genre aimed at providing rational explanations of natural phenomena to change the way people live in the world and fight superstition and fear. In particular, Seneca's Stoic perspective requires him to use detailed physical analysis to fight fear since the Stoic God is in principle capable of sending signs as opposed to the Epicurean perspective that God does not concern himself with human affairs.",stoicism
sextus-empiricus,What is the implication when it is mentioned that Sextus is using Stoic terminology and casting the issue in Stoic terms?,"This implies that Sextus is following the Stoic philosophical framework and using their concepts and language, which in this case is related to assenting to an impression that something is true (P).",stoicism
sextus-empiricus,Is the idea that Stoic scholarship accepts the issue discussed in Sandbach 1975: 88 as uncontroversial a matter of debate among scholars?,"No, the idea that Stoic scholarship accepts the issue discussed in Sandbach 1975: 88 as uncontroversial is not a matter of debate among scholars; it is widely accepted.",stoicism

sextus-empiricus,What is the significance of the 'criterion of truth' in the Pyrrhonian skeptic's philosophy and in contemporary scholarly debate?,"The 'criterion of truth' is highly significant in Pyrrhonian skepticism as it forms the crux of debates concerning whether a Pyrrhonian skeptic can hold beliefs. The notion of a criterion of truth was pivotal in both Stoic and Epicurean epistemologies, adding weight to its relevance in philosophical discussions.",stoicism
sextus-empiricus,What were the Epicureans and Stoics in agreement about with regards to truth?,"The Epicureans and Stoics agreed that there were criteria of truth, but they had different opinions about what those criteria were specifically.",stoicism
sextus-empiricus,"What are the two conceptions of the criterion of truth in ancient Greek philosophy, according to Brunschwig?","The two conceptions of the criterion of truth in ancient Greek philosophy, according to Brunschwig, are the 'adelic' conception which emphasizes the role of the criterion in the discovery of unclear things, and the 'prodelic' conception which emphasizes that those truths delivered by the criterion are clearly true. The Epicureans held the 'adelic' conception, while the Stoics held the 'prodelic' conception.",stoicism
shaftesbury,What is the debate concerning Shaftesbury's relationship to Stoicism?,The debate centers around whether Shaftesbury can be considered a Stoic thinker in its entirety or if some of his ideas align with Stoicism while others do not.,stoicism
shaftesbury,What does Shaftesbury's use of the Askemata notebooks suggest about his approach to Stoic principles?,"Shaftesbury's use of the Askemata notebooks suggests that he had Stoic ideas in the forefront of his mind and that he believed they were key to becoming the person he wanted to be. He engages in a process of self-improvement based on Stoic principles and quotes Stoic sources throughout these notebooks. Additionally, Shaftesbury's unpublished works such as Pathologia and Chartae Socraticae show his endorsement of Stoicism and rejection of contemporary philosophy.",stoicism
shaftesbury,What is the main idea of the strong Stoic interpretation of Shaftesbury's philosophy and what illustration does he use to convey this idea in Characteristicks?,"The main idea of the strong Stoic interpretation of Shaftesbury's philosophy is an exclusive concern with the state of one's own soul, which is within one's own control, and a resultant withdrawing of concern from everything else. This is conveyed in Characteristicks through the illustration of a ship on a bay and a ray of light on a still dish of water, which represents the calm serenity that comes from focusing on one's internal state and not allowing anything external to disturb it. This illustration echoes quotations from Marcus and Epictetus on the power of one's view and the state of one's soul.",stoicism
shaftesbury,What is one aspect of Shaftesbury's thought that commentators have noted as not fitting with the Stoic view?,One aspect of Shaftesbury's thought that commentators have noted as not fitting with the Stoic view is his concern with the public good and his endorsement of pity.,stoicism
shaftesbury,"Why might Shaftesbury discuss aesthetic beauty in his works, according to those who support the strong Stoic interpretation?","According to those who support the strong Stoic interpretation, Shaftesbury discusses aesthetic beauty as a means of attracting a wider audience towards a moral position that would otherwise be unappealing if presented in its raw form. In essence, aesthetic beauty serves as a decoy or sugar-coating, making his Stoic message more palatable while concealing his true belief that aesthetic beauty holds no value.",stoicism
shaftesbury,What does Shaftesbury consider as the metaphysical component of beauty?,"Shaftesbury considers ""Unity of Design"" as the metaphysical component of beauty. He believes that anything which has multiple parts that can be in unity with each other can be beautiful.

shaftesbury,How do some commentators view Shaftesbury's perspective on the relationship between art and virtue?,"Some commentators view Shaftesbury's perspective on the relationship between art and virtue as affirming the intrinsic value of virtue, while regarding art as having only an instrumental value in promoting virtue. They associate Shaftesbury with a backward-looking stance, reminiscent of Stoicism.",stoicism
shaftesbury,How does Shaftesbury reconcile his belief in the naturalness of morality and beauty with his contention that proper education is necessary to achieve them?,"Shaftesbury reconciles this apparent contradiction through the Stoic concept of prolepsis. Prolepses are mental anticipations or pre-conceptions of notions that do not depend on instruction or experience. However, prolepses are not fully formed concepts and can be poorly developed and misapplied. Therefore, practice and cultivation are necessary to give prolepses their most complete form and apply them properly. This allows Shaftesbury to argue that ethics requires the right application of affections and that mistaken ethical judgments result from a defect in the application of the natural rule of honesty and worth.",stoicism
skepticism-medieval,What standard do Stoics propose must be met in order for something to be considered as known?,"According to Stoics, in order for something to be considered as known, its truth must be such that it could not possibly be mentally caused by anything other than what it actually is in fact caused by. For instance, if an internal mental image or concept of a tree's being beside a house could be caused by a dream, then the tree's being beside the house cannot be known, even if the tree is in fact beside the house.",stoicism
smith-moral-political,"How does Smith conclude The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and what does this suggest about his perspective on moral philosophy?","Smith concludes The Theory of Moral Sentiments by presenting the virtues of prudence, benevolence, and self-command through character portraits in Part VI, and offering a short history of moral philosophy in Part VII that highlights the contributions of Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. This suggests that Smith might look forward to a revival of ancient Greek ethics and values, focusing on virtuous character rather than specific decision procedures.

sophie-de-grouchy,How do Stoics argue that concern for others is natural to human beings?,"Stoics argue that concern for others is natural to human beings by invoking the concept of oikeiosis, which holds that infants have a natural concern for self-preservation that grows to extend to an impartial concern for all as they mature. They observe that infants learn to recognize their own bodies as belonging to them and use them for their own survival, and that this tendency develops further in human beings to include caring for their young and even cosmopolitanism.",stoicism
sophie-de-grouchy,"What philosophical view towards morality might Grouchy's emphasis on pain and pleasure imply, as suggested in some of her discussions of what it means to do the right thing?","Grouchy's strong emphasis on pain and pleasure might suggest that her moral theoretical leanings are towards consequentialism rather than Stoicism. Her discussions of what it means to do the right thing seem to be informed by consequentialism, as evidenced by her claim in Letter V that acts receive reason's approval depending on the extent to which they benefit humanity, and her suggestion in Letter VIII that the value of the law can be measured in part in terms of the pleasure and pain it produces.",stoicism
sophie-de-grouchy,What philosophical view did Cabanis appreciate in Stoicism that he tried to reconcile with his agreement with Grouchy about the role of pain in sympathy and morality?,Cabanis appreciated the possibility of atheism that still saw something divinely pleasing in all living things in Stoicism. He was attracted to this view because it allowed him to reconcile his agreement with Grouchy about the role of pain in sympathy and morality with his rejection of the Stoic view that pains and pleasure don't matter morally.,stoicism
sophie-de-grouchy,Why does Cabanis argue that the Stoics' view that pain is not bad is inconsistent with their humaneness?,"Cabanis argues that if pain was not an evil, we would not find it necessary to discount it in ourselves or others. Therefore, the fact that the Stoics exhibit humaneness and concern for others in the face of pain suggests that they do in fact view pain as an evil, contrary to their explicit philosophical position.",stoicism
sophie-de-grouchy,Can Stoics disregard pain when it comes to acting?,"No, Stoics do not countenance the view that pain should be ignored when it comes to acting. This is demonstrated by examples of Cato giving up his horse for his companion on a scorching road in Sicily and Brutus giving his coat to a sick slave on a freezing winter night.",stoicism

stoicism,What is the role of pneuma in Stoic philosophy?,"In Stoic philosophy, pneuma is the 'sustaining cause' that holds all existing bodies together, gives them their qualities, and makes them unified objects. It is a body that is blended 'through and through' with passive elements such as water and earth, and its movement inward and outward gives it tensility. Pneuma plays a role similar to Aristotle's substantial form in that it makes something an individual 'this.' The Stoics also developed a theory of mixture that allowed for two bodies to be in the same place at the same time in relation to pneuma.",stoicism

stoicism,How do Stoics understand the relationship between impulses or desires and reason?,"According to Stoics, impulses or desires are movements of the soul toward something, and in a rational creature, these are exercises of the rational faculty which do not arise without assent.

stoicism,"How do Stoics understand causation in relation to events, in contrast to most contemporary thinking about causation?","Stoics analyze causation as a relation among events, but they do not have a specific vocabulary for events in their philosophical terminology.

This approach differs significantly from most contemporary thinking about causation, which treats it as a relation between events.",stoicism
stoicism,"What is the Stoic view on causation, in contrast to Aristotle's, regarding the necessity of explanatory factors?","The Stoic view on causation posits that causal processes necessitate their effects, in contrast to Aristotle's view which considers causal processes as factors that bring about effects 'always or for the most part'. This distinction is reflected in the Stoic concept of 'fate', which is described as a sequence of inescapable causes, while Aristotle's four causes function more as different kinds of explanatory factors without the same level of necessity.",stoicism
stoicism,What is Chrysippus' analogy for explaining how character influences human action in Stoicism?,"Chrysippus uses the analogy of a cylinder being pushed to explain how character influences human action in Stoicism. Just as the cylinder's shape determines whether it rolls or slides after being pushed, a person's character determines their decisions and actions after being prompted by external events.",stoicism

These incomplete lekta require additional elements, such as a referring term or ostensive reference, to form complete lekta.",stoicism
stoicism,What kind of logic did the Stoics contribute to in contrast to Aristotle's term logic?,"The Stoics made progress in what we now call propositional logic, developing accounts of propositional negation, conjunction, disjunction, and entering the debate over the correct understanding of conditionals. Their accounts of connectives joining simple propositions into complex ones also led them into questions about modal concepts such as possibility, impossibility, necessity, and contingency.",stoicism
stoicism,What is the connection that Chrysippus made between fatalism and causal determinism?,"Chrysippus connected logically-motivated fatalism with causal determinism by arguing that if there was motion without a cause, it would mean that some propositions would not be either true or false.

stoicism,How did the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus argue against the idea that what is impossible does not follow from what is possible?,"Chrysippus used the example of the conditional statement ""if Dion is dead, then this one is dead,"" where ostensive reference is being made to Dion. He argued that if we suppose the antecedent (Dion being dead) is true, then by modus ponens it follows that ""this one is dead."" However, he noted that the proposition that ""this one is dead"" is impossible, since one cannot make the requisite ostensive reference to a dead man so as to make it true. This may seem ad hoc, but it is consistent with Stoic views on definite or deictic propositions.",stoicism

stoicism,What is the Stoic view on the relationship between knowledge (epistêmê) and cognition (katalêpsis)?,"The Stoic view holds that knowledge (epistêmê) requires cognition (katalêpsis) that is secure, firm, and unchangeable by reason. This cognition must also be systematically integrated with other cognitions in order to constitute knowledge. Mere assent to a cognitive impression is not sufficient for knowledge; it only amounts to cognition or grasp of an individual fact.",stoicism
stoicism,What is an example of how the Skeptics attempted to refute the Stoic definition of cognitive impressions?,"The Skeptics pointed to cases of insanity, such as Heracles having a false impression that his children were his enemy's children and killing them.

stoicism,What principle did the Stoics appeal to in response to the claim that it is impossible to distinguish between two identical objects?,"The Stoics appealed to the principle of the identity of indiscernibles in response to the claim that it is impossible to distinguish between two identical objects.

stoicism,What is the Stoic view on the existence of an intermediate state between wisdom and ignorance?,"The Stoics do not allow for an intermediate state between wisdom and ignorance.

stoicism,"What is the brain in a vat scenario, and how does it challenge the Stoic view of cognitive impressions?","The brain in a vat scenario is a modern skeptical hypothesis where scientists electrically stimulate a person's brain to produce sense impressions indistinguishable from their genuine experiences of the external world, such as tables, chairs, and fireplaces. This scenario challenges the Stoic view of cognitive impressions by demonstrating that there could be false impressions identical to true ones, contradicting Stoic claims that cognitive impressions ""could not arise from that which is not"" and that they are ""such as could not arise from that which is not.""",stoicism
stoicism,"What is the difference between a true clear and distinct impression and a false one, according to the Stoics?","According to the Stoics, the difference between a true clear and distinct impression and a false one is that the true impression is caused by the thing it represents (e.g., a fireplace), while the false impression is caused by some other means (e.g., manipulation of neurons by brain scientists).",stoicism
stoicism,What type of theory does the Stoic view resemble in its emphasis on external factors for knowledge acquisition rather than subjective availability of evidence?,"The Stoic view resembles externalist theories of knowledge or justification, as they both maintain that an agent can know or be justified in believing a proposition even when the evidence is not subjectively available to them.",stoicism
stoicism,What strategy does the Stoic sage employ when presented with an impression that seems to be cognitive but might be deceptive?,"The Stoic sage suspends judgement when presented with an impression that seems to be cognitive but might be deceptive, or he assents only to the impression that it is reasonable that there is fireplace here (as Sphaerus did about the pomegranates). This strategy makes it difficult to distinguish the Stoic sage from a skeptic who takes 'the reasonable' as his criterion.",stoicism
stoicism,"What is the role of specifying the goal or end of living in Aristotle's ethics, in relation to other philosophical systems?","In Aristotle's ethics, specifying the goal or end of living provides a general overview or summary of the ethical teaching, similar to a dust jacket blurb or course description. This allows for comparison with other philosophical systems, which may have radically different specifications of the goal or end of living.",stoicism

This definition cannot be fully understood without taking into account their views about value and human psychology.",stoicism
stoicism,What significant distinction does Stoicism make between things that have value and things that are good?,"In Stoicism, there is a crucial distinction between things that have value (axia) and things that are good. Goodness is reserved only for virtues or characteristic excellences of human beings, while value is attributed to certain indifferent things, such as health or wealth. These indifferent things with value are typically appropriate, fitting, or suitable for humans and are thus preferred, even if they do not secure happiness on their own.",stoicism
stoicism,What is the Stoic doctrine of oikeiôsis and how does it provide a foundation for an objective ordering of preferences?,"The Stoic doctrine of oikeiôsis is the idea that all animate things have an original impulse towards what is appropriate for them or aids in their self-preservation. This doctrine provides a foundation for an objective ordering of preferences because it suggests that there is a natural ordering of what is appropriate for each part of the world, including individual human beings. As humans mature, they come to recognize that more than basic necessities are appropriate to them and that other rational creatures, as well as moral virtue, are also appropriate to them. This recognition of what is appropriate leads to an objective ordering of preferences, with moral virtue being seen as the only good and thus most appropriate thing for humans to value. In this way, the Stoic doctrine of oikeiôsis provides a natural basis for ethical values.",stoicism
stoicism,Does some scholars' view suppose that Stoic moral philosophy is independent from Stoic metaphysics and theology?,"Yes, some scholars' view supposes that Stoic moral philosophy is largely separate from Stoic metaphysics and theology. This view is held by writers such as Annas (1993).",stoicism
stoicism,What is the Stoic view on how one should make decisions when there is a conflict between what is naturally appropriate for oneself and what is naturally appropriate for another rational being?,The Stoic view is that one should choose the course of action that is ultimately in agreement with the unfolding of nature's rational and providential plan. This may involve selecting things that are not typically appropriate to one's own nature when considered in isolation from those particular circumstances.,stoicism

stoicism,What is the role of external goods in Stoic ethics compared to Peripatetic ethics?,"In Stoic ethics, external goods and fortune play no role in happiness, whereas in Peripatetic ethics, external goods such as money are necessary for exercising moral virtues. According to Stoics, rational choice is more appropriate to human nature than external goods, and so long as one orders their preferences virtuously, they will be happy regardless of whether they attain the preferred indifferents they select.",stoicism
stoicism,How does the Stoic view of happiness relate to getting what one wants?,"The Stoic view of happiness is not related to getting what one wants, but rather ordering one's wants rationally regardless of whether they are satisfied.",stoicism
stoicism,What is the Stoic sage's unconditional desire and how does it relate to duty and happiness?,"The Stoic sage has an unconditional desire to live virtuously, which means acting in accordance with moral duty. In this view, virtue is sufficient for happiness because there is no conflict between duty and happiness; whatever the sage conditionally prefers is always subordinate to her conception of the genuine good. This is in contrast to Kant's notion of inclination or desire, which can sometimes conflict with duty. The Stoic sage's self-sufficiency and independence from fortune's vagaries also contribute to the Stoic conception of happiness. Cicero discusses this topic in his Tusculan Disputations, book V.",stoicism
stoicism,What is the concept that Stoics use to refer to an action that is in line with one's nature and has a reasonable justification?,The Stoics refer to such an action as performing a 'proper function' (kathêkon).,stoicism

stoicism,What is the Stoic view on moral progress and how do they illustrate it?,"According to Stoic philosophy, there is no such thing as moral progress in the sense of progress within morality, as virtues are a kind of knowledge and there is no cognitive state between knowledge and ignorance. However, they do acknowledge that one can be closer or farther from finally being able to perform proper functions in a perfected way. To illustrate this point, they use the analogy of drowning, stating that a person an arm's length from the surface is drowning every bit as surely as one who is five hundred fathoms down, suggesting that while progress may not be possible within morality, one can still make progress towards achieving moral actions.",stoicism
stoicism,What is the Stoic explanation for how someone can fear something that they rationally know is not dangerous?,"According to the Stoics, this occurs when there is a rapid and repeated switching of assent in the commanding faculty, where judgement is first made that something is not dangerous, but is then quickly followed by assenting to the impression that it is dangerous, leading to the fearful impulse away from the thing in question.",stoicism
stoicism,How do the Stoics differentiate between normal impulses and passions according to Galen's illustration?,"The Stoics differentiate between normal impulses and passions by suggesting that passions, unlike normal impulses, are excessive, irrational, and have a momentum that carries one beyond the dictates of reason.

stoicism,"How did later Stoic philosophers, who are often grouped under the term ""Middle Stoicism"", view the ideas of earlier Stoics?","Later Stoic philosophers, who are often grouped under the term ""Middle Stoicism"", generally saw themselves as building upon and refining the ideas of earlier Stoics rather than completely abandoning them. They did introduce new ideas and disagreed with some of the earlier Stoic views, often incorporating ideas from other philosophical schools such as Platonism.

stoicism,"Which philosophical school of thought was favored among the military ranks in Rome, and which was preferred by members of the Senate and other political figures?","Epicureanism was favored among the military ranks in Rome, while Stoicism appealed more to members of the Senate and other political figures.

marcus-aurelius,What is the role of phantasia in Plato's Protagoras and how does it compare to an art of measurement?,"In Plato's Protagoras, phantasia, often translated as 'appearance', can be unreliable due to its comparative or perspectival nature (356b-357a).

This idea suggests that impressions, as mentioned in Marcus' work, may also suffer from similar defects of perspective and can benefit from testing against an informed understanding of physical, ethical, and dialectical principles, which provide a picture of the whole.

seneca,What is the role of natural laws in Seneca's philosophy?,"In Seneca's philosophy, natural laws govern events both above and under the earth, playing a crucial role in the functioning of the world. They constitute everything that is going to happen in the world, including earthquakes and even the conflagration of the world when it comes to an end. The natural law also dictates that human beings are mortal and death is a necessity. The study of nature involves accepting this natural law and understanding why death is not fearful. Preparation for death is an essential aspect of the philosophical life, as it helps individuals accept their mortality, which is a fundamental part of natural law.",stoicism
seneca,How does Seneca view the relationship between human life and time in both his natural philosophy and therapeutic practice?,"Seneca views human life as having a finite existence, with its end contained from the beginning, much like the world's life cycle in his natural philosophy. He emphasizes the importance of making diligent use of the present as a means to regain lost time consumed by worldly concerns. In his therapeutic practice, Seneca encourages being aware of the completeness of each day and living it well, as if it contains everything necessary, with no need to stretch out into an uncertain future. Death is seen as an inevitable part of life, and being prepared for it is a key aspect of living well.",stoicism
seneca,What does Seneca consider to be another name for God?,Nature is considered by Seneca to be another name for God.,stoicism
seneca,Why does Seneca believe that the common practice of praying indicates the existence of a caring God?,"Seneca believes that prayer indicates the existence of a caring God because he thinks that people would not engage in such behavior if they did not believe that there was someone listening and caring about their prayers. If people were addressing deaf deities, praying would be an irrational act in Seneca's view.",stoicism
seneca,What does Seneca believe is the role of prayer in relation to fate?,"According to Seneca, prayer cannot change fate as it is the necessity of all events and actions. However, prayer can be effective in dealing with some things since the gods have left some matters unresolved.",stoicism
seneca,What is Seneca's view on virtue and how it relates to perfecting rationality and becoming like God?,"Seneca views virtue as the ideal of becoming like God, which is not an otherworldly ideal but rather the perfecting of our rationality as agents living in this world. He thinks that the virtuous man is an equal to the gods, demonstrating the close relationship between his natural philosophy, theology, ethics, and philosophical psychology. Ultimately, Seneca is concerned with perfecting our soul, which he explores through discussions of virtue, the soul, nature, and theology.",stoicism
seneca,What philosophical tradition emphasizes that moral norms can be derived from nature and human reason?,The ethical tradition of natural law emphasizes that moral norms can be derived from nature and human reason.,stoicism

japanese-zen,What is the Zen perspective on the relationship between a thing-event's specificity and the whole?,"Zen understands the specificity of a thing-event to be a recapitulation of the whole, emphasizing that parts and the whole should be lived in an inseparable relationship through an exercise of nondiscriminatory wisdom, without prioritizing one aspect over another.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"How does Zen's stance of ""not one"" and ""not two"" relate to both dualism and non-dualism?","Zen's stance of ""not one"" and ""not two"" negates both dualism and non-dualism, while allowing for a free, bilateral movement between the two. This position cannot be confined to either dualism or non-dualism, creating a unique third perspective.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the significance of meditation in Zen Buddhism and how is it related to the achievement of enlightenment?,"Meditation is highly significant in Zen Buddhism as it is through meditation that the historical Buddha achieved enlightenment (nirvāna). Meditation is one of the three components of study that a Buddhist is required to master in Zen Buddhism, along with an observation of ethical precepts (sīla) and an embodiment of nondiscriminatory wisdom (prajñā). Meditation is believed to lead to a deepened state of consciousness called samādhi, which is a state of complete concentration and awareness. Zen Buddhists believe that practical, experiential knowledge is more important than theoretical, intellectual knowledge in achieving enlightenment, as the latter is seen as a form of discrimination through language. Instead, Zen Buddhists emphasize the importance of self-cultivation (shugyō) through the training of the whole person in order to prepare for embodying nondiscriminatory wisdom.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the main purpose of using kōans in the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism?,"The main purpose of using kōans in the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism is to assist the practitioner in becoming a ""Zen person"" who fully embodies both wisdom and compassion. Kōans are formulated like riddles or puzzles that cannot be solved through intellectual reasoning alone, driving the ego-consciousness to its limit and breaking through the barrier of dualistic conceptual paradigms, allowing for a breakthrough in understanding.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What is the significance of passing kōans in the Rinzai school of Zen, and what is required for transmission to occur?","Passing kōans is a crucial part of the training in the Rinzai school of Zen, as it demonstrates the practitioner's understanding and attainment of enlightenment. The process involves private consultations with a Zen master who evaluates the practitioner's state of mind. The transmission of enlightenment is said to be possible only between Buddhas (yuibutsu yobutsu), emphasizing the profound and transformative nature of this spiritual exchange.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the purpose of the fifth group of kōans in the most fully developed system?,The fifth group of kōans is designed for the practitioner to go beyond the state of buddhahood by erasing all traces of enlightenment in order to achieve a traceless enlightenment.,zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,"What is the concept of ""practice-realization"" in the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism according to Dōgen?","The concept of ""practice-realization"" in the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism, as articulated by Dōgen, refers to meditation being both a practice and the realization of enlightenment simultaneously. It emphasizes that meditation is not a means to an end, but an end in itself, collapsing the dualistic gap between potentiality and actuality, and between acquired enlightenment and original enlightenment, which are considered non-dual in relation to each other.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does the Sōtō school view the process of meditational practice in terms of enlightenment?,"The Sōtō school sees meditational practice as a gradual deepening process of becoming aware of the original enlightenment, with an expansion of its corresponding experiential correlates and horizons. This is why it is called the school of ""gradual enlightenment"" or ""silent illumination.""",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the recommended order of adjustments Zen meditation practitioners should follow at the beginning of a sitting session?,"The recommended order of adjustments Zen meditation practitioners should follow at the beginning of a sitting session is body, breathing, and mind.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,Why is the adjustment of the body important in Zen meditation and what postures does Zen recognize?,"The adjustment of the body is important in Zen meditation because it helps the practitioner achieve an optimal state of being free by stilling the mind and dissolving various psychological complexes and psychosomatic disorders. Zen recognizes two postures for meditation: the lotus-posture and the half-lotus posture. A long Zen tradition holds that these postures are effective in achieving the benefits of meditation. However, if a lay practitioner cannot assume these postures initially, they can be substituted with sitting on a chair with the spine straight.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the name of the breathing exercise in Zen meditation?,"The name of the breathing exercise in Zen meditation is ""observation of breath count"" or sūsokukan.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What does Zen refer to as ""wandering thoughts"" and how does it affect meditation practice?","In Zen, ""wandering thoughts"" refer to any mental object that prevents the practitioner from concentrating during meditation. Overcoming this is one of the first things a practitioner must learn to do in order to make progress in meditation. These thoughts can include present concerns, worries, fears, and past memories, all of which can distract the practitioner from staying focused on the present moment during meditation.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the neurophysiological location where breathing is controlled and what system controls it under normal circumstances?,"The neurophysiological location where breathing is controlled is found in the hypothalamus, in the mid-brain, and it is controlled by the autonomic nervous system under normal circumstances.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does Zen propose that one can stop the operation of the conscious mind in order to enter a state of meditation?,"Zen proposes accomplishing this by assuming an immobile bodily posture and engaging in breathing exercises, rather than attempting to stop the mind by using the mind directly, which is considered impractical if not impossible.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What is the third stage of meditation in this practice, where there is no more feeling of in-coming and out-going breaths?","In the third stage of meditation, the practitioner enters a deeper state where there is no more feeling of in-coming and out-going breaths. During this stage, there is an prolonged retention of breath due to the reduction of breathing activities.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the psychological mechanism that allows various thoughts and feelings to surface during meditation?,"The psychological mechanism that allows various thoughts and feelings to surface during meditation is the weakening of the suppressive power of ego-consciousness, which occurs when the level of consciousness is lowered.",zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,"What is the state of ""no-mind"" in Zen, and what is its relationship with ego-consciousness?","The state of ""no-mind"" in Zen is not a mindless state or the absence of mind, but rather, it is a state of mind that is free from the conscious activity associated with ego-consciousness in everyday life. No-mind is a transcendent state that goes beyond the everyday mind while still remaining in the everydayness of the world.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What has been the goal of the intellectual effort of European philosophers since the modern period in their attempt to understand human nature?,"The goal of European philosophers since the modern period has been to find new ways to ground our conception of human nature beyond traditional Christian dogmas that had incorporated classic Aristotelian and Platonic views.

japanese-zen,How does Zen view the role of discursive reason in understanding reality?,"Zen maintains that discursive reason is incapable of knowing and understanding reality in its entirety, and instead advocates for seeking understanding through an experiential dimension that goes beyond ego-consciousness and the limitations of Aristotelian logic.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What does Abe mean when he says that Zen maintains a ""positionless position""?","When Abe says that Zen maintains a ""positionless position,"" he means that Zen avoids becoming attached to any particular position or viewpoint. This is because Zen believes that attachment leads to suffering, and it instead cherishes a sense of embodied freedom.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What is the ultimate goal of Zen practice in overcoming dualism?,"The ultimate goal of Zen practice is to overcome the dualistic stance of ego-consciousness and the discursive mode of reasoning that relies on sensory perception as its point of reference. This overcoming aims to transcend the dualistic appearance of reality, such as the outer-inner dichotomy, and ultimately render the experiential domains beyond the sensible world and ego-consciousness transparent, instead of opaque or translucent.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What does Zen propose instead of either-or logic when trying to understand reality as a whole?,"Zen proposes mind-body oneness, an holistic perspective, as it abhors one-sidedness. However, it warns that as soon as 'one' is contrasted with 'two' in a discourse, it is no longer genuine and authentic because it slips into being an idea, an abstraction.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does Zen characterize the relationship between the subject and the object in epistemology from the perspective of modern European philosophy?,"Zen finds that the relationship between the subject and the object in epistemology, as conceived by modern European philosophy, imposes a structuring that is framed dualistically and either-or ego-logically, promoting an oppositional mode of thinking. This structuring causes things to appear dualistically and either-or ego-logically to the epistemological subject, while extending the paradigm to itself for self-understanding as well as things other than itself in the same manner. Furthermore, Zen notes that the subject cannot become the object or vice versa due to their real or ideal distance from each other in space-consciousness or time-consciousness.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What does Zen mean by ""not two"" and how does it relate to the concept of oneness?","In Zen, ""not two"" refers to the idea that any two things that are affirmed to be individually real cannot be truly separate or independent, as they are interconnected and interdependent. This concept is closely related to the idea of oneness, which Zen encourages practitioners to experience in their everyday lives by seeing mind and body, I and others, and I and nature as a unified whole. This perspective is necessary for achieving genuine and authentic knowledge, as a dualistic standpoint can lead to one-sidedness, partiality, imbalance, and prejudice. As Dōgen said, ""When one side is illuminated, the other side remains in darkness."" Zen characterizes this dualistic standpoint as ""human, and all too human.""",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"Why does Zen recommend that the practitioner ""forgets the 'I'"" when engaging in any action?","Zen recommends that the practitioner ""forgets the 'I'"" when engaging in any action because by doing so, the practitioner can achieve an existential negation of the ego-consciousness, which in turn implies a logical negation of the ""I."" This is because Zen believes that this negation cannot be achieved through either-or logic or intellectual reasoning, as both involve two things (such as the thinker and the thought), which can lead to an infinite regress. By forgetting the ""I,"" the practitioner can break this cycle and uproot the ego-consciousness.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does Zen view the role of logical and intellectual methods in understanding truth?,"Zen sees logical and intellectual methods as abstract and divorced from actual reality, lacking consideration for the concreteness and immediacy of lived experience. Zen believes that human beings must be understood as beings rooted in nature, rather than as beings outside of nature who observe it theoretically.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What is the phrase that often appears in Zen dialogues which points to the experience of going beyond ""not one"" and ""not two""?","The phrase that often appears in Zen dialogues which points to the experience of going beyond ""not one"" and ""not two"" is ""no-thought and no-image"" (munen musō).",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"Why is it difficult for someone posing the question of whether there is such a thing as ""no-thought and no-image"" from the everyday standpoint to understand its meaning according to Zen?","According to Zen, it is difficult for someone posing this question from the everyday standpoint to understand the meaning of ""no-thought and no-image"" because they would be relying on either-or logic, which leads to a contradiction when predicating ""is"" on ""no-thought"" or ""no-image."" This is because ""no-thought"" and ""no-image"" cannot be linguistically or logically apprehended from the everyday standpoint.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What does Zen maintain is necessary to understand the concepts of ""no-thought"" or ""no-image""?","Zen maintains that an experiential dimension that goes beyond the oppositional thinking of the everyday standpoint is necessary to understand the concepts of ""no-thought"" or ""no-image"".",zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,"What does Zen's ""no"" signify in the context of the monk's question about a dog having Buddha-nature?","Zen's ""no"" signifies a transcendence of being and non-being, challenging the monk's formulation of the question based on an either-or logical understanding or an affirmation-negation linguistic device. It points to the non-contingent nature of Buddha-nature that is not something that the dog can have or not have, but rather an essential characterization of all beings, springing forth from the ground of being itself, which can be understood as ""absolutely nothing.""",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What is Master Daie's advice to his students when they try to understand Joshū's ""nothing""?","Master Daie advises his students not to rely on either-or logic, discriminatory thinking based on ego-consciousness, bodily action, verbal exchange, metaphysical responses, or texts when trying to understand Joshū's ""nothing"". Instead, he encourages them to find their own original answer.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What does Nishida Kitarō mean when he describes the ground of a person's being as ""absolutely nothing""?","When Nishida Kitarō describes the ground of a person's being as ""absolutely nothing,"" he means that it is a state that cuts off all pairs of polar opposites, avoiding the dangers of nihilistic or relativistic interpretations. This ground is the bottomless source of truth and freedom that Zen practitioners strive to embody through an all-out effort of their entire being, both mind and body, consciousness and unconscious.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,What does Zen tradition designate as 'buddha-nature'?,"In Zen tradition, 'buddha-nature' refers to the possibility to be awakened from fundamental ignorance and become a Buddha. It is emphasized as 'original' or 'natural' knowledge, representing a non-dualistic 'seeing'.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What is the experiential meaning of ""not two"" in Zen Buddhism, as described by Dōgen's enlightenment experience?","The experiential meaning of ""not two"" in Zen Buddhism is described as ""dropping off the body and the mind"" (shinjin datsuraku). This implies that the dualistic relationship between the mind and body has disappeared in meditational awareness, transcending the everyday ego-logical, dualistic standpoint, and merging with a non-dualistic domain of experience.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does Zen understand the concept of self-nature in relation to thing-events that enter into an interdependent causal series?,"Zen understands self-nature as a power that thing-events possess to generate themselves on their own without dependence on anything. However, according to Zen, nothing that enters into an interdependent causal series can be endowed with self-nature, as they must be empty of self-nature in order to enter into the series and undergo change or correction.",zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,"Why does the master bring up the example of a clear, transparent mirror in his explanation of no-thought?","The master brings up the example of a clear, transparent mirror to illustrate that in order for an image (or thought) to appear, there must be something (the mirror facing an object) for it to reflect or grasp. In other words, without an object to think about, there can be no thought.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,Under what circumstance would a disciple ask about a reflection in a mirror if nothing is facing it?,A disciple would ask about a reflection in a mirror if nothing is facing it when they are considering whether a reflection is possible without an object present in front of it.,zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,"What does the master imply about the nature of reflection by a mirror, according to this statement?","The master implies that reflection by a mirror is independent of the object's orientation towards it, meaning that if an object is within the mirror's range, it will always reflect it. This suggests that reflection is not determined by the object's facing the mirror but rather by its presence within the mirror's field of vision.",zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,What is the disciple inquiring about when asking about what nothing can see?,"The disciple is asking about the ability of nothingness to perceive or observe anything, as seeing is often used metaphorically to represent understanding or awareness in philosophical contexts.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does the master describe seeing that makes it unlike an ordinary object or thing?,"The master describes seeing as not being like a thing, suggesting that it is not a tangible or concrete entity that can be directly perceived or interacted with. Instead, seeing seems to be a more abstract and complex process that involves perception, interpretation, and understanding. This description suggests that seeing is a multifaceted and dynamic activity that is closely tied to our cognitive and perceptual faculties, rather than a simple and passive sensory experience.",zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,How does Zen interpret 'just seeing no-thing or nothing' in terms of discriminatory value judgments?,"Zen interprets 'just seeing no-thing or nothing' as seeing or mirroring things without discrimination, meaning that it does not make any discriminatory value judgments when it mirrors an object, whether it is beautiful or ugly. The mirror mirrors thing-events as they are, without taking any stance of likes and dislikes or making any discriminatory value judgments. In other words, it is non-egological in mirroring each thing equally.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does Zen view the relationship between human beings and nature with respect to creativity?,"Zen understands human beings to be ""a being-in-nature,"" meaning that human creativity is of the same order as that of nature.

japanese-zen,"What is the concept of zero-time in Zen, and how does it differ from the everyday understanding of time?","Zero-time in Zen is a non-dualistic experiential dimension that is prior to the bifurcation between the subject and the object, meaning it is not limited by spatial-temporal ordering principles such as those understood by Kant as a priori forms of intuition. In zero-time, there is no distinction between past, present, and future or between before and after, differing from the everyday understanding of time where these distinctions are present. Zen contends that zero-time is the natural and primordial being of all things, including human beings, as they are all grounded in it.

japanese-zen,"How does Zen understand time and space, and how does it differ from other philosophical conceptions of time and space?","Zen understands time and space as an expression of thing-events in their suchness, with zero-time being the original abode of thing-events. This is different from other philosophical conceptions of time and space, such as Thomas Aquinas's or Newton's conceptions of absolute time and absolute space, which impose formal categories on time and space and involve a form-matter distinction. Zen does not understand time and space in this way, but instead sees them as an integral part of experience, rather than as abstract concepts that exist outside of experience.",zen-buddhism
japanese-zen,How does Zen view the relationship between time and space?,"In Zen, time and space are viewed as integrated space-time that is lived in the interfusion of concrete temporalization and spatialization.

japanese-zen,How does Zen's non-dualistic mode of seeing interpret the experience of awareness in meditation?,"Zen's non-dualistic mode of seeing interprets the experience of awareness in meditation as arising from a nondiscriminatory state of meditational awareness, where discrimination occurs on a foundational background that is bottomless and does not distort the shape of things to appear. This discrimination is characterized as nondiscriminatory discrimination, allowing things to announce themselves as they are, without any projection from the unconscious or superimposition of intellectual ideas. This awareness avoids both idealist and empiricist stances, as it renders useless the active-passive scheme as an explanatory model.",zen-buddhism

This means that both the individual and the trans-individual refer to the same person, but their stances operate differently.

japanese-zen,How does Zen understand the concept of freedom differently from British empiricists like John Locke?,"Zen's concept of freedom, known as ""jiyū,"" consists of action arising out of the self on its own, which is not delimited by ego-desire. This is different from Locke's definition of freedom as a lack of external constraint, where freedom is expressed as an ego-desire in the state of nature without external constraint. Additionally, Zen's free action is motivated by a thrust from the creative source in the bottomless ground, while Locke's rationalist model requires rationalizing an irrational desire rooted in the body and unconscious.",zen-buddhism

japanese-zen,"What does Zen mean when it describes freedom as ""stillness in motion""?","When Zen describes freedom as ""stillness in motion,"" it is referring to a state of integrated mind and body where one's movements are not constrained by conscious commands from the mind. Instead, the body moves freely and spontaneously, with the mind completely assimilated into it. This creates a sense of oneness between the mind and body, allowing for a spiritual life-energy called ""ki"" to permeate the body.

Loyalty was a key virtue in bushidō, and it was linked directly to the emperor and the imperial system in State Shintō. The emphasis on dying as the fullest expression of loyalty was particularly strong in bushidō, and it may have been influenced by the Zen Buddhist concept of dying to the ego-self. Bushidō also emphasized the value of makoto, or genuineness and trustworthiness, which had originally Shintō connotations. Additionally, bushidō was influenced by imported nineteenth-century European ideologies of ethnic virtue, which held that the purity of a given race of people formed the basis for a nation state.",zen-buddhism
japanese-philosophy,Why did some of the most talented monks leave Mt Hiei during the medieval period in Japan?,"Some of the most talented monks left Mt Hiei during the medieval period in Japan due to the institutional corruption of monastic centers, the popular belief that Buddhism had entered its final Degenerate Age, and the rise of new Buddhist philosophies that eventually led to the emergence of new religious sects such as Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren.

He also denied emanationism and claimed that in his thought it is not a matter of self-determination of being but rather self-determination of nothingness.

kyoto-school,What was the result of Tanabe's criticisms and provocations on Nishida's philosophy of absolute nothingness?,"Tanabe's criticisms and provocations led Nishida to further develop his philosophy of absolute nothingness into a more dynamic conception of self-determination within the dialectical world, which took place through the mutual interactions between individual persons and things. This evolution was partly due to Tanabe's emphasis on the historical world, irrational elements, and dialectical relations between finite beings.",zen-buddhism
kyoto-school,Who was one of Nishitani's influential teachers who impacted his development of existential and phenomenological aspects of Nishida’s topology of absolute nothingness?,"Nishitani studied with Heidegger between 1937 and 1939, who was beginning to grapple with the question of nihilism and developing his thinking of the “clearing of being” or what he would later characterize as a “topology of being”.

kyoto-school,What is the ultimate goal of overcoming nihilism in Nishitani's philosophy?,The ultimate goal of overcoming nihilism in Nishitani's philosophy is to reach a genuine experience of absolute nothingness or true emptiness on the “field of śūnyatā.” This field is not a vacuum of relative nothingness but an open clearing where beings are freely allowed to come to be and pass away without nullification or reification. It is also the place for genuine interpersonal encounters.,zen-buddhism

kyoto-school,What is the formula that Ueda uses to describe the process of self-identity constitution where an encounter with another person is possible?,"Ueda's formula for self-identity constitution where an encounter with another person is possible is ""I, not being I, am I.""

kyoto-school,What is the concept of the true self as understood in Nishida's philosophy?,"The true self, according to Nishida's perspective, is a ""self that is not a self,"" which is achieved through radical self-negation that returns one to an absolute nothingness.

kyoto-school,"What does Nishitani mean by ""radical subjectivity"" and how does it differ from modern conceptions of subjectivity?","For Nishitani, ""radical subjectivity"" refers to a more originary conception of the human subject that goes beyond modern Western philosophical notions of subjectivity. He sees modern subjectivity as being bound by reifying attachments to things and ultimately to the ego. In contrast, Nishitani's ""radical subjectivity"" involves a kind of non-ego that is expressed as a ""subjective nothingness"". He finds intimations of this idea in sources such as Meister Eckhart's mystical theology and Nietzsche's radical atheism, which go beyond attachments to egoity. The Kantian idea of ethical autonomy is recognized by Nishitani as an advance in this direction, but ultimately seen as a sublated form of self-will.",zen-buddhism

kyoto-school,What kind of openness of the heart-mind is associated with Nishitani's conception of subjective nothingness?,"Nishitani associates the openness of the heart-mind with spontaneous openness that stands within the field of emptiness, granting beings free space needed for their unobstructed interactivity. This is thought in terms of the notions of non-ego (muga) and 'no-mind' or 'mind of nothingness' (mushin).",zen-buddhism
kyoto-school,How did Tanabe relate to the East Asian paradigms of psychological and meontological nothingness despite not using the topological conception of absolute nothingness?,"Tanabe related to the East Asian paradigms of psychological and meontological nothingness by understanding both the relative self and the absolute in terms of a ceaseless movement of affirmation by way of radical negation, thereby philosophically appropriating these paradigms in his own way.",zen-buddhism

kyoto-school,"What was Nishida's approach to problematic phrases such as ""all the world under one roof"" and the ""imperial way"", and why did he choose this approach?","Nishida took up the jargon and slogans of his time, including phrases like ""all the world under one roof"" and the ""imperial way"", and sought to redeem them from their petty provincialism by opening them up to a more universal perspective. He did this because he believed that nations, particularly Japan with the emperor at its spiritual center, had a special role to play in the historical formation of a truly ""worldly world"".

kyoto-school,What is Nishitani's view on how Japanese tradition should be approached in relation to modernity?,"Nishitani argued that Japanese tradition should be creatively appropriated and not conservatively retreated to, emphasizing that there is no turning back to the way things were.
